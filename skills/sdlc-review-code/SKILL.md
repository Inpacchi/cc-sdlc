  Review code changes with domain agents — checks for overengineering, unnecessary code, DRY violations,
  and architecture adherence. Target auto-detects from arguments: no argument reviews uncommitted changes,
  a commit ref reviews that commit, a range reviews the range.
  Use when code changes need review — works on uncommitted changes, specific commits, or commit ranges.
  Triggers on "review this commit", "review HEAD", "review the last commit", "code review",
  "review uncommitted changes", "check my diff", "review before committing", "diff review",
  "review working tree", "look at my changes", "/sdlc-review-code",
  "fix review findings", "fix the review", "address the findings", "fix all findings".
  Do NOT use for reviewing skill/agent files — dispatch the sdlc-reviewer subagent directly.

# Review Code

Review code changes with relevant domain agents. Prioritizes catching overengineered solutions and unnecessary code alongside standard quality checks.

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (optional) — commit ref, commit range, or empty.

## Steps

### 1. Resolve Target

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine what to review:

| Argument | Target | How to Gather |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| None | Uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged) | `git diff HEAD --stat`, `git diff HEAD`, `git status -s` |
| Commit ref (e.g., `HEAD`, `abc1234`) | That commit | `git show --stat {ref}`, `git show {ref}` |
| Commit range (e.g., `abc..def`, `HEAD~3..HEAD`) | Range diff | `git diff --stat {range}`, `git diff {range}` |

**Uncommitted mode — empty diff check:** If there are no uncommitted changes, stop:

> No uncommitted changes to review.

**Uncommitted mode — untracked files:** If `git status -s` shows untracked files that look like new source files (not build artifacts, `.env`, or `node_modules`), warn:

> Note: {N} untracked files not included in the diff — `git add` them first if they should be reviewed.

**Ref mode — invalid ref:** If the ref or range is invalid, tell the user and stop.

### 2. Identify Relevant Domain Agents

Follow `[sdlc-root]/process/agent-selection.yaml` for dispatch rules:
- Tier 1 (domain agents) — always dispatch when the work involves their domain
- Tier 2 (structural agents) — dispatch only when warranted
- Selection process at the end of the file

**Knowledge routing:** After selecting agents, consult `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/agent-context-map.yaml` for each selected agent's entry. Include their mapped knowledge files in the dispatch prompt so agents receive domain context alongside the diff. Read `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/coding/code-quality-principles.yaml` and include it in every `code-reviewer` dispatch — it is the code-reviewer's primary quality reference and applies to every review.

### 3. Dispatch Review Agents

Output a checklist before dispatching:

```
Reviewing {target description}
Files changed: N

Dispatching reviewers:
- [ ] code-reviewer (always)
- [ ] software-architect (always)
- [ ] frontend-developer (touches frontend components)
- [ ] performance-engineer (new store selectors)

Not dispatching:
- ui-ux-designer — logic-only changes, no visual modifications
```

**Roster size — coverage, not headcount.** The roster is `code-reviewer` and `software-architect` (always) plus one reviewer for each domain whose files or concerns the diff touches. "When in doubt" resolves toward covering a touched domain, never toward a second reviewer for a domain already covered. Beyond five reviewers, each additional agent's checklist line must state in one sentence what it uniquely adds (AOP5). High-risk domains (MTS4) always get their specialist, however small the diff. Lenses are prompt content, not headcount — they are never trimmed for small diffs. Read `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/agent-orchestration-patterns.yaml` for AOP5. Read `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/model-tier-strategy.yaml` for MTS4. This dispatch is **review round 1** of the three-round cap that Step 5b enforces.

Where `{target description}` is:
- `uncommitted changes` (no argument)
- `commit {short-sha}: {commit subject}` (commit ref)
- `range {range}: {N} commits` (commit range)

**Scope Discipline — Before Dispatching**

Each domain agent reviews through their own lens — they do not divide the diff by file, they divide it by concern. Two agents can legitimately flag different issues at the same line (e.g., `backend-developer` catches a missing filter; `code-reviewer` catches an unhandled exception at the same location). This is correct and expected. Do NOT pre-deduplicate by excluding an agent because another agent "will cover it."

What agents should NOT do is overlap on *concern*: if `code-reviewer` is already reviewing security boundaries, do not also ask another agent to perform a full security review. Set scope explicitly in dispatch prompts using constraint language: "Review through your [X] lens. Security boundary review is handled by code-reviewer — flag anything that interacts with it, but do not duplicate that lens."

The output of this discipline: each agent's report covers its own non-overlapping concern slice. Overlap in *location* (same file:line) is fine and will be handled at collection time. Overlap in *concern* inflates the finding list with duplicates and creates conflicting recommendations that the author cannot resolve.

**Pre-dispatch — Test Quality Lens**

Beyond "what is NOT tested" (absence analysis), agents must also assess the quality of tests that *are* present. Include this instruction in each relevant agent's dispatch prompt:

> **Test quality check:** For each new or modified test in this commit, verify:
> - Tests assert observable behavior, not internal state or implementation details. A test that checks `component.state.counter == 1` instead of checking what the user sees is testing the implementation, not the contract — it will break on any internal refactor even when behavior is preserved.
> - Test names describe the scenario and expected outcome, not the method under test. `test_item_not_returned_for_wrong_tenant` is a test document. `test_item_query` is a label.
> - Tests are deterministic and order-independent. Any test that relies on external state, prior test data, or wall-clock time without explicit setup/teardown is a latent flake.

Flag behavior-testing violations as `minor` with category `test-quality`. Flag determinism issues as `major` — flaky tests erode the signal value of the entire suite.

**Pre-dispatch — CLAUDE.md Alignment Lens**

The diff may invalidate documented project knowledge. Ask `code-reviewer` to compare the diff against the project's CLAUDE.md (root + any module-/package-level CLAUDE.md whose tree the diff touches):

> **CLAUDE.md alignment check:** For each file changed in this diff, check whether the project's CLAUDE.md (or a CLAUDE.md in the file's package) makes claims that the diff invalidates — file paths that moved or were deleted, conventions that changed, build/test/lint commands that no longer work, dependencies that were swapped or removed, or architecture statements that no longer describe the codebase. Cite the CLAUDE.md line that needs updating and the diff change that invalidated it. Flag stale documentation as `minor` with category `claude-md-staleness`. Escalate to `major` only when the staleness would actively misdirect a future agent (e.g., wrong build command, removed module still listed as canonical).

This is a documentation-correctness check, not a "should we add more documentation" prompt. Do not flag CLAUDE.md for missing context the diff *could* be added to — only for content the diff *invalidates*.

**Pre-dispatch — Architecture Guardrail Lens**

The software-architect runs on every review as the structural counterpart to code-reviewer. Where code-reviewer catches micro issues (DRY, correctness, naming, overengineering at the expression level), software-architect catches macro drift that compounds across changes. Include this instruction in `software-architect`'s dispatch prompt:

> **Architecture guardrail check:** Review this diff for structural health, not code quality (code-reviewer handles that). Specifically:
> - **Boundary violations:** Are responsibilities leaking across module or package boundaries? Imports flowing the wrong direction? Features reaching into each other's internals?
> - **Pattern drift:** Does new code silently introduce a second way to do something the codebase already has a pattern for? If so, flag which existing pattern it diverges from.
> - **Extraction signals:** Are any files, functions, or components growing beyond a single responsibility? Would this change be the right time to extract, or is it premature?
> - **Abstraction fitness:** Are new or existing abstractions earning their complexity? Flag wrappers that pass through without transforming, or indirection that serves exactly one consumer.
> - **Scope discipline:** Does the diff stay within its stated intent, or does it quietly expand into adjacent concerns that should be separate changes?
> - **Dependency health:** Are new dependencies (imports, packages) justified? Do they create coupling that will make future changes harder?
>
> Flag boundary violations and pattern drift as `major` with category `architecture`. Flag extraction signals and scope observations as `minor` with category `architecture`. Escalate to `critical` only when the structural issue would force a rewrite if left to compound (e.g., circular dependency between packages).

This lens complements, not duplicates, the Standard lens's "Architecture adherence" bullet — that bullet checks convention conformance; this lens checks whether the codebase structure is staying healthy over time.

**Pre-dispatch — Commit Message Quality Lens**

The commit message is part of the deliverable — it is the primary record of *why* a change was made. Ask `code-reviewer` to assess the commit message alongside the code:

> **Commit message check:** Verify the subject line uses conventional-commits format (`type(scope): imperative verb`), stays under ~72 characters, and describes the *what* at a summary level. Verify the body explains the *why* — not just what the code does (the diff shows that), but what reasoning led to this approach. Flag a missing body on any commit that introduces a non-trivial design choice as `minor` with category `commit-quality`. Flag a subject line that describes implementation mechanics rather than intent (e.g., "add variable X" vs. "prevent tenant ID from leaking into log output") as `minor`.

Dispatch ALL listed agents in parallel. Each agent receives the full diff and is asked to review using the lenses defined in `[sdlc-root]/process/review-lenses.md` (all lenses apply to code review — see applicability table) plus the pre-dispatch test-quality and commit-message lenses above. Each agent reviews through their domain expertise but applies all applicable lenses. Read `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/agent-orchestration-patterns.yaml` and use the dispatch template from § dispatch_prompt_templates: objective = "Review {target} through your {domain} lens"; owned files = "Read-only — do not modify files"; acceptance criteria = "Return structured findings per the finding format below with severity and category"; out-of-scope = "Do not fix issues — report only. Do not duplicate the {other-agent} lens."

### 4. Collect and Present Findings

Collect all findings. Present them in a single structured report.

**Deduplicate, then calibrate — before building the report.** Both definitions live in `[sdlc-root]/process/finding-classification.md` (§ Finding Deduplication, § Severity Calibration); the critical behavior is inlined here:

1. **Deduplicate first.** The same issue at the same `file:line` from several agents becomes one finding: credit every agent, keep the more detailed description, and keep the highest reported severity. Different issues at the same `file:line` stay separate and are tagged `co-located` in the Category column. The same issue at different locations stays separate with a "See also: Finding #N" cross-reference. Conflicting fix recommendations stay merged with both recommendations attributed — never silently pick one.
2. **Calibrate every severity by impact × likelihood before labelling it** — `critical`: certain or very likely data loss, security breach, or complete failure; `major`: significant functionality impact, likely to manifest; `minor`: partial impact, a workaround exists, or cosmetic. Downgrade a reviewer's inflated label and record why in the finding detail ("Calibrated from agent-reported critical to major: …"). Never downgrade a severity to reach the loop's exit bar — that is demotion. A report where everything is `critical` is a report that gets ignored.

**Report Framing Discipline — Before Writing Finding Details**

The structured findings report is read by a developer who will act on it. How findings are phrased affects whether they produce action or defensiveness. Apply these framing rules when writing the Details section:

- Prefix non-blocking findings explicitly: `nit:` signals "this is stylistic, not blocking." Authors should be able to skip nits without guilt. If it does not get a `nit:` prefix, it is assumed to require action.
- Use question form for uncertain findings — where the issue depends on context the agent may not have: "What happens to active sessions when this migration rolls back?" is better than asserting "This migration will corrupt sessions" when that outcome is conditional.
- Use declarative form for confirmed issues: "This query runs without a tenant filter — results will include other tenants' data."

| Framing form | When to use |
|--------------|-------------|
| `nit:` prefix | Non-blocking stylistic preference; author may ignore |
| Question form | Uncertain finding; outcome depends on context not in the diff |
| Declarative form | Confirmed issue with a clear fix |

```markdown
## Code Review: {target description}

{commit subject if applicable}
{N} files changed | Reviewed by {N} domain agents

### Findings

| # | Finding | Agent | Severity | Category |
|---|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1 | specific finding | agent-name | critical/major/minor | overengineering/type-safety/security/contract/DRY/architecture/correctness/test-quality/commit-quality/claude-md-staleness/adr-drift |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Overengineering Summary

[If any overengineering or unnecessary code was found, summarize the pattern here — e.g., "3 helper functions wrap single operations", "error handling added for impossible states". If none found, say "No overengineering detected."]

### CLAUDE.md Drift

[If any `claude-md-staleness` findings exist, list which CLAUDE.md file(s) and section(s) the diff invalidates and the line(s) that need updating. Authors miss documentation updates by default — surface this as a cross-cutting concern alongside Overengineering. Omit this section entirely when no drift was flagged.]

### Details

| **Total** | **0** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

*(Fill in actual counts. Rows = agents dispatched; columns = calibrated severity after deduplication.)*
```

### 5. Fix Gate

After presenting the report, offer to fix:

> **{N} findings** ({critical} critical, {major} major, {minor} minor)
>
> Fix these findings?

If the user declines, stop here. If the user accepts, classify first, then proceed to Step 5a.

**Classify before fixing.** Emit the Classification Table per `[sdlc-root]/process/finding-classification.md` — one row per deduplicated finding with columns `# | Finding | Agent | Classification | Severity | Rationale`. Code review uses FIX, INVESTIGATE, DECIDE, and PRE-EXISTING. INVESTIGATE: dispatch the relevant agent to diagnose, then reclassify. DECIDE and PRE-EXISTING: ask CD via `AskUserQuestion` — every question to the user uses that tool, never conversational text (Tool Rule in `[sdlc-root]/process/collaboration_model.md`); PRE-EXISTING options: fix now, hand off, skip. Only FIX rows go to Step 5a. Fixes follow the loop's order: `critical` and `major` findings are fixed first; `minor` findings get one batched fix pass once no critical or major findings remain (Step 5b).

### 5a. Fix Findings

**You are the manager.** The canonical rule is in `[sdlc-root]/process/manager-rule.md`. The critical guardrails are inlined here so that skipping the read does not skip the behavior:

**Economics-qualifying fixes — you may self-apply** when ALL are true per the Manager Rule's Delegation Economics Exception: (1) delegation would cost more than the fix itself — in tokens or main-context growth; (2) small and bounded — a few edit sites, no new abstractions; (3) no design judgment — mechanical or following a citable existing pattern; (4) no new context needed — you can decide HOW from what is already in your window. Trivial fixes always qualify: typos, missing imports, unused variables, obvious type annotations, missing `key` props. Every self-applied fix goes through the review loop in Step 5b — self-applied is never self-approved.

**Non-qualifying fixes — dispatch domain agents.** If you need to read surrounding code to decide HOW to fix, it does not qualify. Group non-trivial findings by the most relevant domain agent. Consult `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/agent-orchestration-patterns.yaml` for dispatch discipline (AOP1, AOP9). When dispatching 2+ fixers in parallel, follow `[sdlc-root]/process/parallel-dispatch-monitoring.md`. Each agent receives: the specific findings assigned to them, the original diff, cross-domain knowledge files from the finding agent, and instruction to make the minimal change that addresses each finding. When the fixer differs from the finder, consult `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/agent-context-map.yaml` for the finder's entry and include the cross-domain knowledge files in the fix dispatch prompt.

**If an agent returns without applying its fix, re-dispatch with a revised prompt.** Only a remaining gap that itself passes the economics test may be closed directly (with review).

**Guard modification is in-scope.** If a finding matches a cluster in `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml` that has (or plainly warrants) a mechanized guard, the fix is two-part: fix the instance AND update or create the guard (lint rule, drift test, CI check) so the next instance is caught mechanically. See `[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md` § "Guard Modification Is In-Scope in Review Loops". Guard edits go through the same review loop as any other fix.

**Self-check before proceeding:** Count findings you self-fixed under the economics test. Count findings dispatched to agents. The two numbers must equal the number of findings being fixed this round (every critical and major, or the whole minor batch). If any such finding is neither self-fixed nor dispatched, stop — you missed one.

Before dispatching any fix, record the pre-fix snapshot Step 5b needs (the temporary-index tree hash from `[sdlc-root]/process/review-fix-loop.md` Step C — it never touches the working tree or the real index). After all fixes (self-applied and agent-applied), run the verification gate: tests, type checks, lint, and configured static analysis.

### 5b. Review-Fix Loop

**This loop is mandatory — whether fixes were self-applied or agent-applied.** No shortcuts, no skipping, no claiming it ran when it did not. Step 3's dispatch was **round 1** and reviewed the diff as submitted, so this loop has at most two re-review rounds left under the cap. Mirror item 1's pre-round-1 verification gate does not apply to Step 3 — an on-demand review may target a historical commit — so the gate runs after every fix round (Step 5a). Every re-review round emits the `review-fix-loop.md` Step A checklist (`Review round N of 3 — dispatching (full roster | narrow: raisers + standing reviewers):`) before dispatch. Re-review rosters are picked mechanically (item 5 below): the full Step 3 roster, or the raisers plus `code-reviewer` and `software-architect`. Each re-review's findings go through Step 4's deduplicate → calibrate and the Classification Table before triage.

<!-- MIRROR-START: review-fix-loop.md#code-review-mechanics -->
**Review-fix loop — critical mechanics.** Canonical protocol: `[sdlc-root]/process/review-fix-loop.md`. Shared definitions (severity, deduplication, Open Minor Findings): `[sdlc-root]/process/finding-classification.md`. These steps are inlined so that skipping the read does not skip the behavior.

1. **Verification gate before every round.** Run tests, type checks, lint, and configured static analysis before the first review round and again after every fix round. Fix failures before dispatching reviewers. (Reference docs have no build gate; they skip this step.)
2. **Fresh reviewer subagents, every round.** Dispatch each reviewer as a new subagent in its own context window — never inline, never a resumed reviewer from an earlier round. Re-review prompts include the previous round's findings table and the fix diff, require reading the current artifact rather than recalling it, ask for regressions beyond the prior findings, and state that a clean report is an expected, acceptable outcome. Reviewers report findings only; they never fix.
3. **Deduplicate, calibrate, then classify.** Merge duplicates first: the same issue at the same location becomes one finding that keeps the highest reported severity. Then calibrate every severity by impact × likelihood before labelling it. Then classify each finding in the Classification Table. Never downgrade a severity to reach the exit bar.
4. **Fix critical and major findings each round.** Resolve every INVESTIGATE and DECIDE finding. Minor FIX findings wait: once no critical or major findings remain, they get one batched fix pass. Before dispatching any fix, record the pre-fix snapshot — the tree hash printed by `t=$(mktemp); cp "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/index" "$t"; GIT_INDEX_FILE="$t" git add -A; GIT_INDEX_FILE="$t" git write-tree; rm -f "$t"` (it includes untracked files and never touches the working tree or the real index) — and run the same command after the fixes for the post-fix snapshot.
5. **Re-review roster is mechanical.** After every fix round, including the minor batch pass: if any applied fix was `critical` or `major`, or the touched files (`git diff --name-only` between the pre-fix and post-fix snapshots) go beyond the files named in the fixed findings, dispatch the **full roster**. Otherwise dispatch **only the reviewers who raised the fixed findings, plus the standing reviewers** (code-reviewer and software-architect; for reference docs, the skill's standing reviewer, code-reviewer), scoped to the fix diff. A fix that touches a new domain adds that domain's reviewer. Read the Severity column and compare file sets; do not reason about relevance.
6. **Exit bar.** The loop exits when no `critical` or `major` FIX finding remains open, no INVESTIGATE or DECIDE finding is unresolved, and the accumulated minors have had their one batched fix pass (or the cap leaves no round to re-review it). Minor FIX findings still open go in an **Open Minor Findings** table. They are never silently closed; only CD closes them.
7. **Three-round cap.** At most 3 review rounds per loop: the first round plus up to 2 re-reviews. Every round counts, including the re-review after the minor batch pass and rounds re-opened by External Review Gate findings. At the cap with any `critical` or `major` finding open: stop, escalate to CD via `AskUserQuestion` with the open-findings table, and never claim the loop is clean. At the cap with only minors open: exit with the Open Minor Findings table.
<!-- MIRROR-END: review-fix-loop.md#code-review-mechanics -->

**Fixes inside the loop** follow Step 5a's rules: self-apply only what passes the economics test, dispatch the rest, and run the self-check.

**External Review Gate (optional):** After the internal loop meets its exit bar and before commit, if `[sdlc-root]/external-review.sh` exists and is executable, run the External Review Gate — a cross-vendor (Codex / local LLM) independent second opinion. Its findings re-enter this loop's triage, deduplicated and calibrated alongside internal findings; every internal round they re-open counts toward the three-round cap. The external model never fixes. State any data egress to CD first. Full protocol: `[sdlc-root]/process/external-review-gate.md` (also `[sdlc-root]/process/review-fix-loop.md` Step E). Skip silently if the wrapper is absent.

### 5c. Summary and Commit

When the loop exits under its exit bar, present:

```markdown
## Fix Summary

{N} original findings fixed | {M} of 3 review rounds | Verification gate: passing

Key feedback incorporated:
- [agent-name] specific feedback that was incorporated

### Open Minor Findings

| # | Finding | Agent | Location | Why still open |
|---|---------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | specific finding | agent-name | file:line | batched pass did not resolve it / round cap reached |
```

Omit the Open Minor Findings table only when none are open. Only CD closes its entries.

> Critical and major findings fixed, build passes{, N minor findings listed as open}. Want me to commit?

Do NOT commit automatically — wait for user confirmation.

### 6. Log Recurring Patterns

After presenting the report, scan findings for patterns that recur across files or represent a general class of mistake. If any pattern qualifies, log it to the **recurring patterns file** at `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml`.

**Step 6a. Read the log.** If `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml` exists, read it. If it doesn't exist, create it with the seed structure:

```yaml
# Recurring review patterns — clustered by agent judgment.
# sdlc-audit Dimension 6l scans this file for threshold breaches.
patterns: []
```

**Step 6b. Match or create clusters.** For each pattern worth capturing from this review:

1. Read existing cluster slugs and descriptions in the file.
2. Use judgment: does this pattern match an existing cluster? Same root cause class, same lens, same kind of mistake — even if the specific file or manifestation differs.
3. **If match found:** append a new occurrence entry to that cluster.
4. **If no match:** create a new cluster with a descriptive slug, description, lens category, and the first occurrence.

**Step 6c. Write the log.** Write the updated YAML file. The diff will appear as an uncommitted change the user can inspect before committing.

**Cluster entry format:**

```yaml
patterns:
  - slug: {kebab-case-identifier}
    description: "{one-line description of the recurring pattern}"
    lens: {security|correctness|architecture|DRY|type-safety|overengineering|test-quality|contract}
    first_seen: YYYY-MM-DD
    occurrences:
      - date: YYYY-MM-DD
        commit: {short-sha}
        manifestation: "{what specifically was found in this review}"
        files: [{path/to/affected/file}]
    promoted: false
```

Optional fields appear on clusters after audit-triage decisions — do not remove them when appending occurrences: `knowledge_entry` (path to the promoted knowledge file, set with `promoted: true`), `mechanized_guard` (the lint rule / drift test / CI check that now catches the pattern), and `mechanization_assessed: excluded` + `mechanization_reason` (CD assessed guard promotion and declined — do not re-propose). Schema and lifecycle in `[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md`.

**Step 6d. Surface in the report.** After logging, add a section to the report output:

```markdown
### Patterns Worth Capturing

| Pattern | Occurrences | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| {slug} — {description} | {N} (first: {date}, latest: this review) | {new / recurring / at threshold} |

[If no patterns identified, omit this section.]
```

Mark patterns "at threshold" when they reach 3+ occurrences — these are candidates for knowledge-store promotion and/or mechanized-guard promotion via `sdlc-audit` (see `[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md`). If a new occurrence lands on a cluster that already has a `mechanized_guard`, say so explicitly in the Status column ("recurred despite guard") — that is a guard-effectiveness signal `sdlc-audit` Dimension 6n needs.

**Threshold-crossing trigger:** When this review's logging brings a `promoted: false` cluster with no `mechanized_guard` to 3+ occurrences within Dimension 6l's 30-day sliding window (reuse 6l's threshold definition — do not define a second one), emit directly below the patterns table:

> Pattern {slug} crossed the mechanization threshold ({N} occurrences) — run `/sdlc-audit` to triage mechanization.

Skip clusters marked `mechanization_assessed: excluded` — those were assessed and deliberately not mechanized. This trigger closes the gap between per-review logging and audit-cadence triage: the crossing surfaces the moment it happens instead of waiting for the next audit. It is a nudge only — do not start the triage or write promotion fields from within this skill.

**Slug consistency:** The file itself is the slug registry. Reading existing slugs and descriptions before writing is sufficient for agent judgment to reuse the right slug. When uncertain whether a finding matches an existing cluster, prefer creating a new cluster — false splits are easier to merge than false merges are to untangle.

Do NOT ingest into the knowledge store from within this skill. Do NOT create parking-lot entries. The pattern log feeds `sdlc-audit` Dimension 6l, which handles promotion recommendations.

### 7. HTML Review Artifact (opt-in)

After completing the review report, ask CD whether they want an HTML explainer of it (`sdlc-explain`, **review** storyboard) or a guided walkthrough (`sdlc-walkthru`) — never unprompted. If CD declines both, the markdown report stands as the deliverable and you skip the rest of this step. If CD picks the walkthrough, invoke `sdlc-walkthru` and skip the rest of this step.

If CD accepts, invoke `sdlc-explain` on the report; mechanics in `[sdlc-root]/process/html-rendering.md` § Post-Skill Offer.

Write to: `docs/reviews/{target_slug}_review.html` (e.g., `docs/reviews/HEAD_review.html`, `docs/reviews/abc1234_review.html`, `docs/reviews/uncommitted_review.html`).

The HTML review should include:
- Header with target description, date, and overall finding counts
- File risk map (table with per-file change stats and severity dots)
- Annotated diffs with inline margin comments for each finding (use diff viewer + callout components)
- Overengineering summary section
- CLAUDE.md drift section (if applicable)
- Agent coverage summary
- Findings detail with severity-coded badges
- Recurring patterns section (if any identified)

This is the artifact CD uses for review — it replaces scrolling through terminal output. If `docs/reviews/` doesn't exist, create it.

### 8. Session Learning Capture

Code reviews surface cross-discipline insights — gotchas, anti-patterns, cross-domain friction, and knowledge gaps that go beyond the specific diff. Step 6 captures recurring *patterns* to `recurring-patterns.yaml`, but discipline-level insights (e.g., a testing paradigm gap, an architecture anti-pattern, a DX friction point) belong in parking lots.

If this review surfaced non-obvious learnings beyond the findings themselves, suggest:

> This review surfaced insights that may be worth capturing to discipline parking lots. Consider running `/sdlc-reflect` to surface them.

Skip the suggestion if the review was routine with no cross-cutting insights.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The diff is small, skip some lenses" | Small diffs produce the subtlest bugs. Lenses are prompt content and are never trimmed for diff size; only roster headcount follows touched domains (Step 3). |
| "Just do a quick glance, we're about to commit" | Quick glances miss type safety and contract issues. Run the full workflow. |
| "Agent fixed the issue during review" | Report only during review — fixes go through the fix gate (Step 5) |
| "I'll start fixing without asking" | Always present the fix gate. The user decides whether to fix. |
| "This is just a refactor, no review needed" | Refactors need architecture and DRY lens review |
| "Skip Tier 2, it's a small commit" | Read the diff content. Small commits introduce new patterns more often than expected. A Tier 2 agent whose domain the diff touches stays on the roster. |
| "Add one more reviewer, just in case" | Breadth is per touched domain, not headcount. Beyond five reviewers, each extra agent needs a one-sentence statement of what it uniquely adds. |
| "Re-review only the agents who found issues — the fixes were small" | The re-review roster is mechanical: full roster if any fix was critical or major or touched files beyond the findings; otherwise the raisers plus code-reviewer and software-architect. Never judgment, never skipped. |
| "Round 3 still has a major, but it's close — call it clean" | At the cap with critical or major findings open, stop and escalate via `AskUserQuestion` with the open-findings table. Never claim the loop is clean. |
| "software-architect will catch what code-reviewer catches" | They have non-overlapping scopes. code-reviewer handles micro (DRY, correctness, naming). software-architect handles macro (boundaries, dependency direction, pattern drift). Neither substitutes for the other. |
| "This agent overlaps with another, skip it" | Agents review different concerns. `performance-engineer` and `frontend-developer` both review component code but catch different issues. |
| "No security concerns in this diff" | Check the boundaries lens anyway. User input flows through surprising paths. |
| "Two agents flagged the same line, merge them" | Same line, same issue — merge and credit both. Same line, different issues — keep separate and tag `co-located`. Merging by location erases real findings. |
| "One agent called it critical, that settles it" | Severity is calibrated after collection, not inherited from the loudest agent. Apply the impact x likelihood criteria before finalizing the severity label. |
| "An agent recommended refactoring the whole module while reviewing" | Scope creep in a finding. A finding must name a specific problem and a surgical fix. If the fix requires rewriting code outside the commit's scope, flag the specific issue and note the broader refactor as a separate tracking issue — not a required fix in this review. |
| "The agent phrased every finding as a command" | Findings on uncertain issues should be questions. Findings on confirmed issues should be declarative. Using command form for a speculation inflates the author's cognitive load. |
| "The diff doesn't add docs, so no CLAUDE.md issue" | The CLAUDE.md alignment lens checks for *invalidated* claims, not missing ones. A path rename, dropped command, or deleted module that CLAUDE.md still references is a finding regardless of whether the diff adds documentation. |
| "CLAUDE.md feels out of date in general — flag it" | The lens is scoped to claims the *current diff* invalidates. Out-of-date content unrelated to this diff is for `claude-md-improver` audits, not commit-scoped review. |

## Integration
- **Feeds into:** `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml` (pattern log for `sdlc-audit` Dimension 6 promotion), `sdlc-reflect` (suggests it when cross-discipline insights surface beyond the findings themselves)
- **Uses:** `[sdlc-root]/process/agent-selection.yaml` (agent dispatch), `[sdlc-root]/process/review-lenses.md` (review lenses), `[sdlc-root]/process/review-fix-loop.md` (fix loop), `[sdlc-root]/process/finding-classification.md` (severity, deduplication, classification, Open Minor Findings), `[sdlc-root]/process/manager-rule.md` (fix delegation), `[sdlc-root]/process/collaboration_model.md` (AskUserQuestion Tool Rule), `[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md` (mechanized-guard schema and in-scope rule), `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/agent-context-map.yaml` (dispatch-time injection), `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/coding/code-quality-principles.yaml` (code-reviewer primary)
- **Complements:** `sdlc-execute` (development phase before review), `sdlc-audit` (promotes recurring patterns to knowledge store)
- **Does NOT replace:** Quality gates in `sdlc-develop-skill` / `sdlc-develop-agent` (those are author-facing convention checks, not diff-facing code review)
