description: >
  Unified SDLC auditing skill with four modes: compliance, improvement, deep verify, and codebase
  health. Compliance mode audits project structure, deliverable integrity, knowledge layer health,
  and migration correctness. Improvement mode analyzes sessions and/or commits to identify process
  gaps, missing knowledge, and skill modifications that would improve the SDLC itself. Deep Verify
  mode is an opt-in multi-judge content sweep of already-promoted knowledge-store entries —
  expensive, never runs by default. Codebase Health mode audits the product substrate itself —
  test/CI activation, agentic ergonomics, observability blind spots — via parallel read-only
  sweeps. Compliance and improvement can run against the current session or be fed a previous
  session or commit range. Triggers on "sdlc audit", "audit the sdlc", "run an sdlc audit",
  "compliance audit", "audit this session", "audit for improvements",
  "what can we improve about the process", "sdlc health check", "check sdlc compliance",
  "audit these commits", "process improvement audit", "deep audit", "deep verify",
  "verify the knowledge store", "full content sweep", "codebase health check",
  "audit the codebase health", "health audit", "how healthy is the codebase".
  Use when you need to verify SDLC compliance, identify process improvements, evaluate knowledge
  layer health, re-verify promoted knowledge content, or assess codebase health.
  Do NOT use for generating playbooks from sessions — use sdlc-playbook-generate.
  Do NOT use for bulk knowledge import — use sdlc-ingest.

# SDLC Audit

Unified auditing for structural compliance, process improvement, retroactive knowledge verification, and codebase health. Four modes, flexible inputs.

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (mode + optional source — see Input Resolution below)

<!-- MIRROR-START: headless-mode.md#headless-stop-rule -->
**Headless runs (no person present).** This run is headless if the caller's prompt or appended system prompt has a line starting `SDLC headless mode:`, or if no ask-the-user tool (`AskUserQuestion`, or the harness's equivalent such as OpenCode's `question`) can be used — none is available or loadable, or a call to it is denied without an answer. A dispatched subagent is never headless itself; in a headless run the orchestrator tells each subagent so, and the limits below bind it too. In a headless run, every point in this skill that asks CD something the next step depends on, waits for CD's approval, or escalates to CD **stops the run there**: save the work so far, return the questions, the document or action plan awaiting approval, or the open-findings table as the run's result (in the caller's output schema if it passed one), and end the turn normally — a stop is a result, not an error. A missing precondition the caller must fix ends the run with status `failed` and the reason. Never guess an answer, take a default for a decision CD owns, approve your own work, or skip the gate. List questions the next step does not depend on in the result instead of stopping. Take the no path on optional offers. Cause no side effect outside the working tree — no push, post, comment, label, publish, external send, or live-system change — unless the caller's prompt names it; list those actions in the result. Reads are fine. A question the prompt or thread already answers is not a gate. Full rule and result format: `[sdlc-root]/process/headless-mode.md`.

## Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Compliance** | Verify SDLC structure, deliverables, knowledge layer, migration integrity | Findings table + audit artifact at `docs/current_work/audits/` |
| **Improve** | Identify process gaps, missing knowledge, skill/workflow modifications | Improvement proposals targeting skills, process docs, knowledge stores, disciplines |
| **Deep Verify** | Multi-judge re-verification of already-promoted knowledge-store content (opt-in, expensive) | Demotion candidates routed into interactive triage; sweep logged to provenance |
| **Health** | Audit the product substrate — test/CI activation, agentic ergonomics, observability blind spots | Per-sweep "exists / missing / top-5 gaps" report at `docs/current_work/audits/`; gaps route to handoffs or plans |

## Input Resolution

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine mode and source:

| Invocation | Mode | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|
| `/sdlc-audit` (no args) | Compliance | Current project state |
| `/sdlc-audit compliance` | Compliance | Current project state |
| `/sdlc-audit compliance <session>` | Compliance | Specific session — did it follow process? |
| `/sdlc-audit compliance <commit(s)>` | Compliance | Specific commits — do they have proper artifacts? |
| `/sdlc-audit improve` | Improve | Current session |
| `/sdlc-audit improve <session>` | Improve | Past session |
| `/sdlc-audit improve <commit(s)>` | Improve | Specific commits |
| `/sdlc-audit improve <session> <commit(s)>` | Improve | Session + commits combined |
| `/sdlc-audit deep-verify` | Deep Verify | Full knowledge store (scope confirmed in pre-flight) |
| `/sdlc-audit deep-verify <scope>` | Deep Verify | Scoped: a domain name, `stale`, or `incremental` |
| `/sdlc-audit health` | Health | Whole repo, all three sweeps |
| `/sdlc-audit health <scope>` | Health | Scoped: a package/directory path, or one sweep name (`tests`, `ergonomics`, `observability`) |

**Deep Verify never activates implicitly.** A bare `/sdlc-audit` runs compliance mode only — Deep Verify requires the explicit mode word (or an equivalent by-name request like "deep audit" / "verify the knowledge store").

**Identifying sessions vs commits in arguments:**
- Session identifiers: UUIDs, quoted names, or search terms (resolved against JSONL files)
- Commit identifiers: 7+ char hex strings, commit ranges (`abc123..def456`), or branch names
- When ambiguous, ask the user

**Session location:** Session JSONL files live in `~/.claude/projects/<project-dir-hash>/`. Locate by scanning for matching content or session ID. See `references/session-reading.md` for JSONL structure.

## Compliance Mode

Verify the project's SDLC health across 9 audit dimensions. Full methodology in `references/compliance-methodology.md`.

### Workflow

```
DISPATCH AUDITOR → REPORT → TRIAGE → FIX
```

### Steps

### 1. Dispatch Auditor

Dispatch the `sdlc-compliance-auditor` subagent to perform the 9-dimension scan. Read `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/agent-orchestration-patterns.yaml` and use the subagent dispatch template from § dispatch_prompt_templates — objective: "Scan all 9 compliance dimensions and return structured findings"; acceptance criteria: "Return per-dimension score (0-10), overall score, categorized findings with severity, and promotion candidates for knowledge/discipline stores."

**Audit Dimensions (summary):**

1. **Deliverable catalog integrity** — `docs/_index.md` matches reality
2. **Artifact traceability** — spec → plan → result chains complete
3. **Untracked work detection** — git commits without deliverable tracking
4. **Knowledge freshness** — CLAUDE.md, agent memories, docs current
5. **Process health indicators** — tracked vs untracked ratio, archive freshness, changelog coverage
6. **Knowledge layer health** — disciplines, knowledge stores, triage status, wiring, context map, playbooks, usage, staleness by age, cross-file contradictions, coverage gaps, orphaned knowledge pruning, review-pattern recurrence, mechanized-guard freshness
7. **Migration integrity** — manifest version, file completeness, content-merge correctness
8. **Agent memory pattern mining & hygiene** — recurring findings worth promoting; oversized (>200 line/25KB), self-contradicting, code-contradicting, or orphaned agent-memory files
9. **Recommendation follow-through** — previous audit recommendations acted on?

When fed a session or commits (not just current state):
- **Session input:** Read the conversation and verify SDLC process was followed — were skills invoked? Were deliverable IDs assigned? Were specs written before execution?
- **Commit input:** Check whether commits have corresponding deliverable artifacts. Cross-reference commit messages against `docs/_index.md`. Flag substantial multi-file changes without tracking.

### 2. Report

Produce audit artifact at `docs/current_work/audits/sdlc_audit_YYYY-MM-DD.md` using the report format in `references/compliance-methodology.md`. Present findings to user in this standardized format:

```
[Audit Type]: [Score]/10 — [Verdict]

[Verdict Label]: [Pass/Fail/Partial]

[1-2 sentence summary of what was checked and the outcome]

Action Items

| # | Severity | Finding | Action |
|---|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO | [concise finding] | [what to do] |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... |
```

**Format rules:**
- One-line header with score and verdict
- Brief summary paragraph — no more than 2 sentences
- All findings in a single table with Severity, Finding, and Action columns
- Severity levels: CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO, Cosmetic
- Action column says what to do (not just "see report") — e.g., "Fixed during audit", "Remove old directory", "Historical only, no risk"
- No narrative between findings — the table IS the report
- Offer to fix actionable items at the end

**Post-write: offer an explainer or a walkthrough.** Ask CD whether they want an HTML explainer (`sdlc-explain`, **report** storyboard) or a guided walkthrough (`sdlc-walkthru`) of the audit report — never unprompted. Mechanics and the precedes-approval rule: `[sdlc-root]/process/html-rendering.md` § Post-Skill Offer.

### 3. Triage

After presenting the audit report, run an interactive triage session if there are:
- **Promotion candidates** (from Dimensions 6c, 6l, and 8a) — parking lot entries, recurring review patterns, or agent memories worth promoting to knowledge stores; 6l candidates may additionally (or instead) be **guard-promotion candidates** — mechanizable patterns that should become a lint rule, drift test, or CI check per `[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md`
- **Guard freshness findings** (from Dimension 6n) — recorded guards that are missing, ineffective (pattern recurred despite guard), or increasingly suppressed; CD decides modify or retire
- **Prune candidates** (from Dimension 6k) — orphaned knowledge files not wired to any agent
- **Memory hygiene candidates** (from Dimension 8b) — oversized (>200 line/25KB), self-contradicting, code-contradicting, or orphaned agent-memory files

See `references/compliance-methodology.md` step 11 for the full workflow.

**Promotion triage:** Present candidates grouped by discipline. CD decides: promote to knowledge store, defer (with reason), or skip. For 6l candidates flagged mechanizable, the choices extend to: promote to a mechanized guard, or both knowledge + guard. Knowledge promotions apply immediately. Guard promotions record the `mechanized_guard` field and hand the guard's implementation to the project (typically a follow-up via `sdlc-lite-plan` or `sdlc-handoff` — the framework defines the contract, the project writes the rule/test).

**Prune triage:** Present orphaned knowledge files grouped by severity. CD decides: prune (delete), wire (add to agent mappings), or keep (leave unwired). Wiring uses the same flow as sdlc-ingest step 6 — present candidate agents, update `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/agent-context-map.yaml`.

**Memory hygiene triage:** Present the flagged `MEMORY.md` files (oversized, self-contradicting, or contradicting code) and orphaned agent-memory directories. CD decides per item: **fix**, defer, or keep. Fold these into the **same** `AskUserQuestion` batch as the prune candidates — do not open a second gate. The read-only auditor only reports these with file+line evidence; the fixes are applied by this skill's orchestrator (which has Write) in Step 4 — split an oversized `MEMORY.md` into `{topic}.md` files with pointers, remove a contradicting/duplicated line, or delete an orphaned directory. This is why hygiene fixes do not require the domain agent itself (many are read-only): the orchestrator applies them directly.

### 4. Fix

Offer to fix actionable items from the findings. Apply fixes the user approves.

## Improvement Mode

Analyze sessions and/or commits to identify how the SDLC itself should evolve. Full methodology in `references/improvement-methodology.md`.

### Workflow

```
LOCATE → EXTRACT → CATEGORIZE → PROPOSE → (optional) APPLY → CHANGELOG
```

### What to Look For

**Process friction** — moments where the SDLC process slowed the work down, was bypassed, or didn't have guidance for the situation:
- Skills invoked but not helpful (wrong workflow for the task)
- Skills not invoked when they should have been
- Manual steps that should be automated in a skill
- Decision points where the process offered no guidance

**Knowledge gaps** — information that was needed but didn't exist in the knowledge layer:
- External docs consulted that should be in knowledge stores
- Patterns discovered during work that should be codified
- Gotchas encountered that no knowledge file warned about
- Agent dispatches that lacked necessary context

**Skill deficiencies** — specific skill behaviors that produced suboptimal results. Read `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/dx/skill-quality-rubrics.yaml` and evaluate against SQR-01–SQR-10 for concrete scoring:
- Steps in a skill workflow that were skipped or done out of order
- Missing phases that the work required
- Agent recommendations in skills that were wrong for the task
- Template sections that didn't fit the actual output needed
- Triggering accuracy failures (SQR-01/02: skill fired when it shouldn't or didn't fire when it should)
- Anti-pattern flags (SQR-07: OVER_CONSTRAINED, BLOATED_SKILL, MISSING_TRIGGER)

**Structural gaps** — missing infrastructure in the SDLC:
- Task types that have no playbook but should
- Disciplines being exercised without a parking lot
- Agent roles that aren't mapped in the context map
- Process docs that contradict each other or are outdated

### Improvement with Commit Input

When fed commits (without a session):
- Read commit messages and diffs for process signals
- Look for patterns: commits that fix previous commits (correction signal), config-only commits after feature commits (setup gap), multiple small commits to the same file (iteration signal)
- Cross-reference against existing playbooks — does the commit pattern match a playbook? If so, were the playbook's steps followed?
- Check whether the commits produced or updated SDLC artifacts (specs, plans, results)

### Output

Present categorized improvement proposals:

| 3 | disciplines/deployment.md | Add entry | Service dependency ordering | Low |
```

### Applying Improvements

When the user approves proposals, apply changes directly:
- Skill modifications → edit the SKILL.md
- Knowledge additions → create/update YAML files
- Discipline entries → add to parking lot with `[NEEDS VALIDATION]`
- Process doc updates → edit the relevant process file
- New playbook proposals → note for `sdlc-playbook-generate` (don't auto-create)

Update `[sdlc-root]/process/sdlc_changelog.md` for every process change applied.

## Deep Verify Mode

Opt-in retroactive content verification: re-judge already-promoted knowledge-store entries with the multi-judge mechanics of the Promotion Verification Gate (`[sdlc-root]/process/discipline_capture.md` § Promotion Verification Gate), verdicts read as `KEEP|DEMOTE`. Full specification in `references/deep-verify.md` — this section is the summary.

### Workflow

```
PRE-FLIGHT → SCOPE → PAYLOAD → JUDGE → TRIAGE (step 11) → APPLY → PROVENANCE
```

**Orchestrator-run.** Do NOT dispatch the `sdlc-compliance-auditor` for this mode — it requires `AskUserQuestion` gates, judge dispatches, and egress disclosure. The orchestrator drives it directly.

**Non-negotiable gates:**

1. **Pre-flight confirmation before any judging:** one `AskUserQuestion` covering the cost estimate (entry count → judge-call counts), egress disclosure (if the external wrapper is a hosted model, name it), scope selection (full / domain / stale-only / incremental), and any files whose claims-vs-reference classification is ambiguous.
2. **Findings route into the existing step 11 triage** as demotion candidates — no parallel triage flow. Batch-level approval per discipline; factual-error dissents and splits listed individually.
3. **Demotions apply only after CD approval**, via the comment-preserving mechanics in `references/deep-verify.md` § 6 and step 11c's Demote path.
4. **The sweep is logged to `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/provenance_log.md`** with `source-type: audit-sweep` — one entry per sweep, recording scope, judge configuration, and counts.

## Codebase Health Mode

The other three modes audit the *process*; this mode audits the *product substrate* — the codebase's readiness to catch bugs before they ship and to be worked on safely by agents. Full methodology in `references/codebase-health.md`.

### Workflow

```
SCOPE → SWEEP (3 parallel, read-only) → SYNTHESIZE → ROUTE
```

### Steps

1. **Scope.** Default is the whole repo, all three sweeps. A path argument scopes all sweeps to that package/directory; a sweep name (`tests`, `ergonomics`, `observability`) runs only that sweep repo-wide.

2. **Sweep.** Dispatch three parallel **read-only** subagents, one per dimension (do NOT use the `sdlc-compliance-auditor` — it is process-scoped; use general read-only research agents with the sweep prompts from `references/codebase-health.md`):
   - **Test & CI activation** — test-file/source ratios per package, suites that exist but never run in CI, lint/typecheck/format gate coverage, runtime-validation coverage at trust boundaries
   - **Agentic ergonomics** — per-package CLAUDE.md coverage with spot-check accuracy, largest-file hot spots, duplication/fork patterns, dead weight, script discoverability (one-shot verify), type-safety escape-hatch clustering
   - **Observability blind spots** — error-reporting coverage per surface, swallowed catches, structured-logging presence, scheduled-job failure alerting, silent fallbacks

   Each sweep returns: **what exists / what's missing / top-5 gaps most likely to let bugs ship.**

3. **Synthesize.** Merge the three sweep reports into a single artifact at `docs/current_work/audits/codebase_health_YYYY-MM-DD.md` using the report format from `references/codebase-health.md`. Present with the same table-first format rules as compliance mode. Offer an explainer or a walkthrough (opt-in, same mechanics as compliance Step 2).

4. **Route.** This mode does not fix. Offer to route each accepted gap into the existing machinery: `sdlc-handoff` for cross-session tracks, `sdlc-plan`/`sdlc-lite-plan` for work CD wants started, or discipline parking lots for insights that need validation first. Gaps that match recurring-pattern clusters should reference the cluster slug — a health gap plus a recurring pattern is a guard-promotion signal (`[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md`).

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The process looks fine, no improvements needed" | Every session has friction. Look harder at correction signals and mid-stream discoveries. |
| "A compliance audit found knowledge issues, I'll deep-verify too" | Deep Verify is opt-in by name. Report the finding; CD decides whether to run the sweep. |
| "I'll fix everything without asking" | Present proposals first. The user decides what to change. |
| "This is just a compliance audit with extra steps" | Compliance checks structure. Improvement analyzes behavior. Different inputs, different outputs. |
| "I'll propose sweeping process changes" | Proportional recommendations. Small friction gets small fixes. |
| "The session didn't follow SDLC, that's a compliance failure" | For improvement mode, process bypass is a signal, not a failure. Ask: why was it bypassed? That's the improvement. |
| "Health mode found gaps, I'll start fixing them" | Health mode reports and routes — fixes go through handoffs/plans that CD approves. |
| "The guard exists, skip the freshness checks" | 6n exists because guards rot: rules get disabled, tests get skipped, patterns mutate past the regex. Check all four signals. |

## Integration

- **Dispatches:** `sdlc-compliance-auditor` subagent (compliance mode 9-dimension scan); judge dispatches per the Promotion Verification Gate (deep verify mode — orchestrator-run, never via the auditor); three parallel read-only sweep agents (health mode — never via the auditor)
- **Complements:** `sdlc-playbook-generate` (playbooks capture "how to repeat"; this captures "how to improve")
- **Feeds into:** skill modifications, knowledge store updates, discipline parking lots, process doc changes; health-mode gaps route to `sdlc-handoff` / `sdlc-plan` / `sdlc-lite-plan`; 6l/6n guard decisions per `[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md`
- **Uses:** session JSONL, git history, all SDLC project artifacts, existing knowledge layer
