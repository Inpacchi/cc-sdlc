# SDLC Reflect — Session Learning Capture

Surface learnings from a work session into discipline parking lots. The goal is to capture reusable, non-obvious insights that emerged during work — especially sessions where formal SDLC skills were not invoked and discipline capture didn't run automatically. As a closing pass, the skill also attempts to prune agent memories the session touched or invalidated, so stale memories don't accumulate between audit cycles.

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (optional — description of what to focus the reflection on, or "all" for a full session scan)

## When This Applies

Use after any work session where you did substantive work but discipline capture didn't run automatically. Two main scenarios:

**A. Sessions without formal SDLC skills:**
- Direct dispatch sessions — CD was steering, agents were doing work, no plan artifact
- Bug fix sessions — diagnosed and fixed an issue without a deliverable
- Exploratory coding — prototyped something, learned things, didn't use `sdlc-idea`
- Refactoring sessions — restructured code, discovered patterns or anti-patterns
- Integration work — wired up external services, hit gotchas worth recording

**B. After SDLC skills that lack built-in discipline capture:**
- After `sdlc-debug-incident` closeout — cross-discipline insights beyond the postmortem's Lessons Learned
- After `sdlc-review-code` — gotchas, cross-domain friction, or anti-patterns surfaced during review
- After `sdlc-tests-run` — testability issues, architecture gaps, or testing patterns discovered during the fix loop
- After `sdlc-tests-create` — coverage gaps that reveal missing knowledge or discipline-level blind spots
- After `sdlc-create-reference-doc` — knowledge gaps and cross-domain friction surfaced during documentation
- After `sdlc-playbook-generate` — discipline-level insights beyond what the playbook itself captures

These skills suggest running `/sdlc-reflect` at completion when non-obvious learnings surfaced.

Signs this skill is NOT appropriate:
- You just finished `sdlc-execute`, `sdlc-lite-execute`, `sdlc-plan`, `sdlc-lite-plan`, `sdlc-idea`, or `sdlc-design-consult` — those already ran discipline capture
- You want to import external articles/transcripts — use `sdlc-ingest`
- You want to explore an idea — use `sdlc-idea`
- Nothing non-obvious happened — skip it, don't fabricate entries

## Preconditions

- At least one substantive work action in the current session (commits, file edits, agent dispatches, research)
- Discipline parking lots exist at `[sdlc-root]/disciplines/`
- Agent memory pruning (Step 5) additionally requires `.claude/agent-memory/` to exist — skip that step silently if it doesn't

## Steps

### 1. Survey the Session

Review what happened in this session to build a picture of the work done:

1. **Recent commits** — run `git log --oneline -20` and `git diff HEAD~5 --stat` (adjust range to cover the session's work)
2. **Uncommitted changes** — run `git status` and `git diff --stat` for work in progress
3. **Conversation context** — what agents were dispatched, what problems were solved, what friction was encountered

Present a brief session summary:

```
SESSION SUMMARY
Work: [1-2 sentence description of what was done]
Files touched: [count] ([key areas])
Agents dispatched: [list] | none (manual work)
Duration signal: [commit count and time span]
```

### 2. Identify Learnings

Scan the session for insights across two dimensions.

**Structured detection** — signals from `[sdlc-root]/process/discipline_capture.md` applicable in standalone mode. The full protocol defines seven signal types; two (`UNMAPPED_KNOWLEDGE`, `STALE_KNOWLEDGE`) require agent handoff data (`knowledge_feedback.loaded`) that isn't available in standalone sessions. The five session-inferrable signals:

| Signal | What to look for |
|--------|-----------------|
| `MISSING_KNOWLEDGE` | A problem was solved that no knowledge file covers — would a future agent benefit from having this documented? |
| `CROSS_DOMAIN_FRICTION` | Work required expertise outside the primary domain — did a backend change need design knowledge, or vice versa? |
| `RESURFACING_PATTERN` | Did you fix something you've fixed before, or see the same issue in multiple places? |
| `GOTCHA_DISCOVERED` | Did a library, API, or framework behave unexpectedly? |
| `ANTI_PATTERN_HIT` | Did you refactor away from a pattern that was causing problems? |

**Freeform scan** — beyond the structured signals, ask:

- What would I tell a colleague starting similar work tomorrow?
- What assumption turned out to be wrong?
- What took longer than expected, and why?
- What pattern emerged that applies beyond this specific task?

**Filtering criteria — include if:**
- Reusable beyond this specific task
- Non-obvious — an agent wouldn't derive it from reading the codebase
- Actionable — it changes how future work should be done

**Filtering criteria — exclude if:**
- Obvious to any competent practitioner
- Specific to this exact task with no generalizable lesson
- Already captured in an existing knowledge file or discipline entry

### 3. Categorize by Discipline

Map each identified learning to its target discipline. Read `[sdlc-root]/disciplines/README.md` for the full discipline list if needed.

| Discipline | Typical learnings |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `coding` | Implementation patterns, refactoring insights, language gotchas, testability lessons |
| `architecture` | System design discoveries, integration patterns, boundary issues, performance insights |
| `testing` | Test strategy insights, coverage gaps, flaky test patterns, tool gotchas |
| `design` | UI/UX patterns, accessibility discoveries, component interaction issues |
| `data-modeling` | Schema insights, migration patterns, query optimization discoveries |
| `deployment` | CI/CD friction, infrastructure gotchas, release process learnings |
| `observability` | Monitoring gaps, debugging workflow improvements, logging patterns |
| `business-analysis` | Requirements clarifications, domain model insights, stakeholder feedback patterns |
| `product-research` | User behavior observations, competitive insights, feature viability signals |
| `process-improvement` | SDLC friction, workflow improvements, tool integration insights |
| `dx` | Developer experience friction, documentation gaps, onboarding obstacles |

Present the categorized learnings for confirmation:

```
LEARNINGS
─────────────────────────────────────────────
[N] learnings identified across [N] disciplines

  coding (2):
    1. [Brief description of learning]
    2. [Brief description of learning]

  architecture (1):
    1. [Brief description of learning]

Write to parking lots? (y / adjust / skip)
```

Wait for confirmation. The user may adjust categorization, remove entries, or add ones you missed.

### 4. Write to Parking Lots

For each confirmed learning, Append to `[sdlc-root]/disciplines/*.md` under `## Parking Lot`.

**Entry format:**

```
- **[date] [context]**: [insight]. [NEEDS VALIDATION]
```

**Context format:** `[session: {brief-slug}]` — e.g., `[session: fix-auth-race-condition]`, `[session: refactor-payment-flow]`.

For auto-detected structured gaps, use the GAP format adapted from `[sdlc-root]/process/discipline_capture.md`:

```
- **[date] [session: {slug}]**: [GAP:{type}] {description}. [NEEDS VALIDATION]
```

The canonical GAP format includes `Source: {agent} finding` — omitted here because sdlc-reflect infers gaps from git history and conversation context, not from agent handoffs.

**Rules:**
- Default triage marker is `[NEEDS VALIDATION]` — do not mark as `[READY TO PROMOTE]` unless the learning has been validated through repeated use
- One insight per bullet — keep entries atomic for independent triage
- Include enough context that the entry is useful without the conversation history
- Write directly — the Manager Rule does not apply to parking lot entries (per `[sdlc-root]/process/discipline_capture.md`)

### 4b. Recurring-Pattern Guard Scan

If `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml` exists, run a session-scoped version of `sdlc-audit` Dimension 6l's threshold scan — same thresholds, same criteria, no redefinition (canonical logic in the compliance methodology; guard contract in `[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md`). Skip silently if the file doesn't exist.

1. For each cluster with 3+ occurrences in the 30-day window and no `mechanized_guard`: if the pattern is mechanizable (textual, structural, or behavioral signature), flag it as a **guard-promotion proposal** with the signature named. Skip clusters marked `mechanization_assessed: excluded` — CD already assessed those and chose not to mechanize; never re-propose them.
2. For each cluster that gained an occurrence this session *despite* having a `mechanized_guard`: flag it as **guard ineffective**.

Present flags in the Step 6 report. Do NOT write `mechanized_guard` fields or implement guards here — proposals route to the next `sdlc-audit` triage (or CD can invoke it now). This step exists so a threshold crossed mid-cycle surfaces within the session instead of waiting for the next audit.

### 5. Prune Agent Memories

Attempt a session-scoped prune of agent memories. This is a lighter-weight complement to sdlc-audit's project-wide memory hygiene sweep — scoped to memories this session plausibly touched or invalidated, not a full scan of every agent. Skip silently if `.claude/agent-memory/` doesn't exist.

**Scope — check only:**
- Memories of agents dispatched during this session
- Any agent's `MEMORY.md` whose claims cover code changed this session (compare memory claims against the session's diff from Step 1)

**What to prune** (hygiene rules per the agent template's memory protocol; canonical check definitions in sdlc-audit's compliance methodology, Dimension 8b):

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Entry contradicts current code — especially claims this session's changes invalidated | Remove or correct the entry. Verify against source before touching it — a memory that merely *looks* stale may still be right. |
| Same fact or tuned value stated twice with drifted numbers | Keep the value matching current code, delete the rest |
| `MEMORY.md` at or approaching the load cap (~180 lines or nearing 25KB) | Split the largest topics into `{topic}.md` files beside it, leave one-line pointers |
| Memory directory for an agent that no longer exists in `.claude/agents/` | Flag for deletion — never delete without explicit confirmation |

Size checks apply only to `MEMORY.md` (topic files are uncapped by design), but correctness pruning applies to topic files too when a MEMORY.md pointer leads to one with invalidated claims.

**Promotion check — do this before deleting anything.** While scanning, evaluate each memory entry you touch against the Step 2 filtering criteria (reusable beyond the task, non-obvious, actionable). An entry can warrant a parking lot entry whether it's being pruned or kept:

- **Pruned entries:** the entry may be stale as stated but carry a generalizable lesson — e.g., a memory invalidated by this session's change often documents *why* the old approach failed, which is exactly a `GOTCHA_DISCOVERED` or `ANTI_PATTERN_HIT` signal. Capture the lesson before deleting the entry.
- **Kept entries:** a correct memory that's transferable domain knowledge rather than codebase-specific scratchpad belongs to everyone, not one agent (per the agent template: "your memory is for you; knowledge stores are for everyone"). Route a copy to the parking lot; leave the memory in place.

Most memory entries are codebase-specific shortcuts and will not qualify — apply the same exclusion filters as Step 2 and don't promote for the sake of promoting.

Present proposed prunes and promotions together before applying:

```
MEMORY PRUNES
─────────────────────────────────────────────
  [agent-name]: [N] entries stale (invalidated by [change]), [N] duplicates
  [agent-name]: MEMORY.md at [N] lines — split [topic] to topic file

PROMOTION CANDIDATES (memory → parking lot)
  [discipline]: [insight, one line] (from [agent-name], pruned|kept)

Apply prunes and write promotions? (y / adjust / skip)
```

Confirmed promotion candidates are written using the Step 4 entry format with context `[memory: {agent-name}]` instead of `[session: {slug}]`, still marked `[NEEDS VALIDATION]`.

If nothing needs pruning or promoting, say so in one line and move on — don't manufacture entries to have something to show.

### 6. Report

Present what was captured:

```
REFLECT REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Session: [brief description]

ENTRIES WRITTEN
  [discipline]: [count] entries
  [discipline]: [count] entries
  Total: [count] entries across [count] disciplines

SAMPLE ENTRIES
  - [discipline]: [first entry text, truncated]
  - [discipline]: [first entry text, truncated]

SKIPPED
  [count] potential insights filtered (obvious: N, task-specific: N, already-captured: N)

MEMORY PRUNES
  [agent-name]: [what was pruned/split] | none needed | no agent-memory directory
  Promoted to parking lots: [count] entries ([disciplines]) | none qualified

GUARD SIGNALS (from recurring-patterns scan)
  Guard-promotion proposals: [slug — signature — proposed guard type] | none at threshold | no pattern log
  Guards recurred-despite: [slug — guard location] | none

NEXT STEPS
  - Entries are marked [NEEDS VALIDATION] — they'll be triaged during the next sdlc-audit cycle
  - [If any entry looks ready to promote]: Consider promoting [entry] to [target knowledge file] after further validation
```

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Nothing happened worth capturing" | If the session involved substantive work, run the structured detection signals before concluding there's nothing. But if genuinely nothing non-obvious surfaced, that's fine — skip it. |
| "I'll mark these as READY TO PROMOTE" | Default is NEEDS VALIDATION. A single session's learning hasn't been validated through repeated use. |
| "I'll dispatch an agent to write the parking lot entries" | The orchestrator writes parking lot entries directly — Manager Rule does not apply to process documentation. |
| "I'll also update the knowledge YAML files" | Reflect captures raw insights to parking lots. Promotion to knowledge stores is a separate triage step (sdlc-audit or manual). |
| "This belongs in the knowledge store, not a parking lot" | Parking lot is the landing zone. Even high-confidence insights start here. The triage cycle promotes what's validated. |
| "I'll skip the user confirmation step" | Always present categorized learnings before writing. The user may disagree with categorization or want to adjust. |
| "I should run this after every session" | Only when substantive work happened AND formal skills didn't already capture. Most direct-dispatch or bug-fix sessions are good candidates. |
| "I'll create a new discipline for this learning" | Route to the closest existing discipline. New disciplines require the criteria in `[sdlc-root]/disciplines/README.md` § "Creating a New Discipline". |
| "I'll do a full sweep of every agent's memory while I'm at it" | Session scope only — agents dispatched this session or memories the session's changes invalidated. The project-wide hygiene sweep is sdlc-audit Dimension 8b. |
| "This pattern hit the threshold — I'll write the mechanized_guard field now" | Step 4b proposes; the audit triage (or CD explicitly) decides. Reflect never writes guard fields or implements guards. |
| "This memory looks outdated, I'll delete it" | Verify against current source first. Deleting a correct memory costs the agent hard-won context; pruning applies only to entries you've confirmed are wrong, duplicated, or over-cap. |
| "It's stale, delete it and move on" | Run the promotion check first. A memory invalidated by a change often documents why the old approach failed — capture that lesson in the parking lot before the entry disappears. |
| "This memory is useful, so it should be promoted" | Useful to *that agent* isn't the bar. Promote only entries that pass the Step 2 filters — reusable beyond the task, non-obvious, actionable. Codebase-specific scratchpad stays in memory. |
| "Memory pruning failed / no memories exist, so the reflect failed" | Pruning is best-effort. Note it in the report and finish — parking lot capture is the primary deliverable. |

## Integration

- **Depends on:** Substantive work in the current session; discipline parking lots at `[sdlc-root]/disciplines/`
- **Feeds into:** Discipline triage cycle (sdlc-audit scans parking lots for threshold breaches and untriaged entries)
- **Uses:** `git log`, `git diff`, `git status` (session survey); `[sdlc-root]/disciplines/*.md` (write targets); `[sdlc-root]/process/discipline_capture.md` (structured gap detection methodology); `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml` + `[sdlc-root]/process/guardrail-lifecycle.md` (guard scan, Step 4b); `.claude/agent-memory/*/MEMORY.md` (prune targets, Step 5)
- **Complements:** Built-in discipline capture in sdlc-execute, sdlc-plan, sdlc-idea (those run automatically; this is for sessions without those skills)
- **Does NOT replace:** sdlc-ingest (bulk external knowledge import), sdlc-audit improvement mode (systematic process gap analysis), built-in discipline capture steps in execution/planning skills
- **DRY notes:** Structured detection uses five of seven signals from `[sdlc-root]/process/discipline_capture.md` — standalone mode omits `UNMAPPED_KNOWLEDGE` and `STALE_KNOWLEDGE` (require agent handoff data). GAP entry format omits `Source: {agent} finding` (documented in Step 4). The difference: discipline_capture.md runs embedded within other skills with full triage table and agent handoff data; sdlc-reflect runs standalone and infers from git history and conversation context. Memory-prune hygiene checks (Step 5) reuse the definitions in sdlc-audit's compliance methodology Dimension 8b and the agent template's memory protocol — sdlc-reflect applies them session-scoped between audits; sdlc-audit remains the project-wide sweep. The Step 5 promotion check parallels sdlc-audit's Dimension 8a pattern mining but differs in bar and destination: 8a requires recurrence across 2+ agent memories and routes to interactive triage; reflect promotes opportunistically (single entry, Step 2 filters) and routes to parking lots as `[NEEDS VALIDATION]` — the triage cycle still decides what graduates to knowledge stores.
