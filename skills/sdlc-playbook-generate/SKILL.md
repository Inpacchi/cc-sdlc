description: >
  Generate structured playbooks from the current conversation context or from previous session files
  and their associated git commits. Reads the current session directly when invoked mid-conversation
  or with no argument — no session ID or description required. Can also analyze past sessions via
  JSONL lookup when a session identifier is provided. Analyzes both what worked (the process to
  formalize) and what was missed (corrections, setup gotchas, environment gaps, service configuration
  that surfaced mid-execution). Produces playbooks following the project's existing playbook template
  format. Triggers on "make a playbook from", "analyze session", "generate playbook",
  "create playbook from session", "playbook from that session", "let's make a playbook for",
  "formalize that into a playbook", "turn that session into a playbook",
  "what did we learn from that session", "extract a playbook", "make a playbook from this",
  "playbook from what we just did", "turn this into a playbook", "playbook from this session",
  "make a playbook", "create a playbook".
  Use when a completed session or set of commits should be formalized into a reusable playbook.
  Do NOT use for creating playbooks from scratch without session data — write those directly.
  Do NOT use for bulk knowledge import — use sdlc-ingest.
  Do NOT use for session resumption — use sdlc-resume.

# Playbook Generation from Session Analysis

Extract structured, reusable playbooks from completed session conversations and their git history. The goal is to capture both the **process that worked** (steps to formalize and repeat) and the **gap that didn't** (corrections, missed setup, environment surprises, configuration gotchas that only surfaced during execution).

**This skill produces a playbook artifact in `[sdlc-root]/playbooks/`. It does NOT produce specs, plans, or implementations.**

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (optional — playbook scope hint, session name/ID, or search term. When empty or referencing the current session, the skill reads the current conversation context directly.)

## When This Applies

Use this when the user has completed work and wants to formalize the process into a repeatable playbook. The hallmark is retrospective analysis — the work is done, and now the user wants to capture what they learned.

Signs this skill is appropriate:
- "Make a playbook from this" / "Turn this into a playbook" (current session — no argument needed)
- "Let's make a playbook from the Slack bot session" (past session — name as argument)
- "Analyze that session and create a playbook for integrations" (past session with scope hint)
- The user just finished a non-trivial task and wants to prevent the same friction next time
- A session involved corrections mid-stream that indicate missing process knowledge

Signs this skill is NOT appropriate:
- Writing a playbook from scratch without session data → write directly using `[sdlc-root]/playbooks/example-playbook.md` as template
- Importing knowledge from external content → `sdlc-ingest`
- Resuming an incomplete session → `sdlc-resume`

## Core Principles

**Context-first, arguments-second.** When invoked without a session ID, read the current conversation directly — you already have full access to everything that happened. Don't require the user to summarize or describe what they want a playbook for when you can see the work yourself. Arguments are for scoping, not for explaining.

**Two sources of truth, not one.** The conversation reveals what happened (intent, friction, corrections, discoveries). The git log reveals what was produced (code, config, migrations). Neither alone tells the full story. Cross-reference both.

**Friction is the signal.** The most valuable parts of a playbook are the steps that weren't obvious — the env var that was missing, the database migration that was forgotten, the service that needed restarting, the config that was wrong on first attempt. Scan for user corrections, re-dos, "oh wait" moments, and error-fix cycles.

**Formalize the happy path too.** The process that got you 90% there is the backbone of the playbook. Capture the step sequence, agent selection, and knowledge context that worked — the gap analysis layers on top of that foundation.

**Concrete over abstract.** Playbook steps reference specific files, specific env vars, specific service names. "Configure the database" is useless. "Add DATABASE_URL to Railway service env vars, run prisma migrate deploy, verify connection with prisma db pull" is a playbook.

**One playbook per task type.** A session might touch multiple concerns. The playbook covers the repeatable task pattern, not the specific session. Generalize the steps while preserving the specific gotchas.

## Workflow

```
RESOLVE SOURCE → CORRELATE → ANALYZE → DRAFT → PLACE → REPORT
```

Sequential. Each step must complete before the next. The user confirms scope (step 2) before deep analysis begins.

## Steps

### 1. Resolve Source

Determine where to read the session data from. Two paths — current context or past session file.

**Path A — Current session context (default when no session ID is provided):**

Use this path when:
- `$ARGUMENTS` is empty
- `$ARGUMENTS` references the current session ("this", "what we just did", "this session", etc.)
- `$ARGUMENTS` describes a playbook topic without referencing a specific past session

The current conversation IS the source data. You already have full access to it — every user message, assistant response, tool call, correction, and error is visible in the conversation context. No JSONL file lookup needed.

**Extract from current context:**
- The sequence of work performed (tool calls, agent dispatches, files read/written/edited)
- User corrections, feedback, "oh wait" moments, and error-fix cycles
- Decision points and the choices made
- The overall task type and scope of work completed

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty and the conversation contains substantial work, infer the playbook topic from the work performed. If the conversation is too short or ambiguous to infer a playbook topic, ask the user: "What aspect of this session should the playbook cover?"

**Path B — Past session lookup (when a session name/ID is provided):**

Use this path when `$ARGUMENTS` contains a session name, search term, or session ID that refers to a different session.

Sessions are stored as JSONL files in the project's Claude directory:

```
~/.claude/projects/<project-dir-hash>/<session-id>.jsonl
```

**Resolution strategy:**
1. If the user provides a session name or search term, scan JSONL files for matching content (first user messages, topic keywords)
2. If the user provides a session ID, locate the file directly
3. If ambiguous, present candidates with timestamps and first user message for the user to pick

**Extract session metadata:**
- Session ID and timestamp range (first to last message)
- Project directory (from the JSONL path)
- Message count and approximate conversation length

Present the located session for confirmation before proceeding.

### 2. Correlate with Git History

Identify git commits associated with the session's work.

**For current session (Path A):** Use the commits made during this conversation. Check `git log` for recent commits, cross-referencing with files you observed being created or modified during the session.

**For past session (Path B):** Use the session's timestamp range:

```bash
git log --after="<session_start>" --before="<session_end>" --format="%H %ai %s" --reverse
```

**Build the correlation map (both paths):**
- List all commits with their messages and timestamps
- For significant commits, read the diff summary (`git diff --stat <hash>~1 <hash>`)
- Identify files created, modified, and deleted during the session
- Note any commits that were amended or reverted (signals of correction)

**Present scope for confirmation:**

```
SESSION SOURCE: [current conversation | session file <id>]
Time span: [start] → [end] ([duration])
Commits: [count] commits touching [count] files
Key files: [top 5-8 files by change frequency]
Playbook target: [user's stated purpose, or inferred task type]
```

Wait for user confirmation. If the user adjusts the playbook scope or target, re-present.

### 3. Analyze

Extract structured insights from the session data. For current session context (Path A), analyze the conversation directly — you already have it. For past session files (Path B), read the session JSONL. See `references/analysis-methodology.md` for the detailed extraction patterns (the same patterns apply to both paths — the difference is only where the data comes from).

**Two-track analysis:**

**Track A — The Process (what worked):**
- Ordered sequence of steps taken (what was done and in what order)
- Agent selection and dispatch patterns
- Knowledge files and references consulted
- Decision points and the choices made
- Codebase patterns leveraged (existing code that informed the approach)

**Track B — The Gap (what was missed or corrected):**
- User corrections ("no, not that", "we also need to", "that's wrong")
- Error-fix cycles (something failed, had to debug and retry)
- Mid-stream discoveries ("oh, we also need to set up X")
- Environment/infrastructure setup that wasn't anticipated
- Configuration values that required trial and error
- Service dependencies that weren't obvious upfront
- Steps that were done out of order and had to be redone

**Cross-reference tracks:** For each gap item, identify where in the process sequence it should have appeared. This produces the corrected, complete process that the playbook will capture.

### 4. Draft the Playbook

Generate the playbook following the project's template format (`[sdlc-root]/playbooks/example-playbook.md`). Read the template first to match the exact structure.

**Key sections to populate from analysis:**

| Template Section | Source |
|-----------------|--------|
| When to use | Generalized from the session's task type |
| Recommended Agents | From Track A agent dispatch patterns |
| Knowledge Context | From Track A knowledge files consulted |
| Typical Phases | From Track A process sequence, corrected by Track B ordering |
| Reference Implementations | From git history — key files created/modified |
| Key Decisions to Surface | From Track A decision points |
| Common Gotchas | From Track B — the core value of the analysis |
| Checklist Before Complete | From both tracks — the full corrected process |

**Gotchas section is critical.** Each gotcha must include:
- What went wrong or was missed
- Why it wasn't obvious (what assumption led to the gap)
- The concrete fix (specific env var, specific command, specific config)

**Generalize but preserve specifics.** The playbook is for the *task type*, not the specific session. But gotchas reference specific technical details — env var names, service configurations, file paths. These are the details that make the playbook actionable.

Present the draft to the user for review before writing.

### 5. Place

After user approval:

1. Write the playbook to `[sdlc-root]/playbooks/<slug>.md`
2. Update `[sdlc-root]/playbooks/README.md` — add entry to the "Available playbooks" table
3. Check if any existing knowledge stores should cross-reference the new playbook (note in report, don't auto-modify)

### 6. Report

```

### 7. Changelog Update

Update `[sdlc-root]/process/sdlc_changelog.md`:

```markdown
## [date]: Playbook Generated — [playbook name]

**Origin:** Session analysis of [session-id] ([brief description of the work])

**What happened:** Analyzed [duration] session with [N] commits to extract repeatable process and gap analysis for [task type].

**Changes made:**

1. **`playbooks/[slug].md`** — new playbook with [N] phases, [N] steps, [N] gotchas
2. **`playbooks/README.md`** — added to available playbooks index

**Rationale:** Formalizing session learnings into a playbook prevents repeated friction. [N] gotchas documented that would otherwise be rediscovered on the next [task type] integration.
```

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I need the user to describe what this playbook is for" | Read the conversation context — you can see what was done. Only ask if the scope is genuinely ambiguous. |
| "I'll just summarize what happened" | Extract process steps and gotchas, not a narrative summary. |
| "The git log tells the whole story" | Git log shows what was committed. The conversation shows what was tried, failed, and corrected. Both are required. |
| "I'll skip the gap analysis, the process is clear" | The gap analysis IS the primary value. A playbook without gotchas is just a generic checklist. |
| "This gotcha is too specific to include" | Specific is good. "Set SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET in Railway" is more useful than "configure environment variables". |
| "I'll generalize away the details" | Generalize the task type, preserve the technical specifics. The env var names, the service configs, the file paths — those are what save time next run. |
| "I'll create the playbook without showing the draft" | Always present the draft for review. The user knows nuances the conversation didn't capture. |
| "The session was messy, I can't extract a clean process" | Messy sessions produce the best playbooks — the mess IS the gap analysis. |

## Integration

- **Feeds into:** Planning skills (`sdlc-plan`, `sdlc-lite-plan`) — playbooks pre-seed agent selection and knowledge context
- **Uses:** Current conversation context (preferred) or session JSONL files, git log, existing playbook template, knowledge stores (for cross-referencing)
- **Complements:** `sdlc-ingest` imports external knowledge; this skill imports internal session knowledge
- **Downstream:** `/sdlc-audit` checks playbook freshness as part of knowledge layer health audits
