description: >
  Capture the current session as a self-contained handoff document for another session to pick up.
  Writes a structured handoff at `docs/current_work/ideas/{slug}_handoff.md` that another session
  can crystallize via `sdlc-idea`, `sdlc-lite-plan`, `sdlc-plan`, or `sdlc-debug-incident`.
  Use when an issue, idea, or out-of-scope work is discovered mid-session that shouldn't be
  addressed in the current context.
  Triggers on "create a handoff", "hand this off", "save this for a new session",
  "write up a handoff", "this is out of scope here", "let's not handle this now",
  "park this for later", "another session should pick this up", "/sdlc-handoff".
  Do NOT use for resuming an existing deliverable — use `sdlc-resume`.
  Do NOT use for archiving completed or resolved work — use `sdlc-archive`.
  Do NOT use for active production incidents — use `sdlc-debug-incident` directly.
  Do NOT use to write a spec or plan — use `sdlc-plan` or `sdlc-lite-plan`.
  Do NOT use for project-wide status snapshots — use `sdlc-status`.
  Do NOT use for open-ended exploration of a new concept where the idea hasn't been examined yet — use `sdlc-idea` directly. A handoff captures session context that's already concrete; an idea explores something that isn't.

# SDLC Handoff

Capture context from the current session into a self-contained handoff document so another session can pick the work up cleanly. The handoff names what was found, where the evidence is, and which skill should open the receiving session.

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (optional — a 1-2 sentence description of what's being handed off; if omitted, the skill will ask)

## When This Applies

Use this skill when the current session has surfaced something that needs work, but addressing it now would derail the work in flight. Common triggers:

- **Issue found mid-implementation** — a bug, defect, or regression in code adjacent to the current task
- **Out-of-scope work discovered** — refactor opportunity, new feature idea, or system gap noticed while doing something else
- **Deferred follow-up** — work the user agreed to do later that's larger than a TODO comment
- **Investigation needed** — an unknown that requires a fresh, focused session to dig into

The handoff is a self-contained capture. The receiving session must NOT need this conversation's context to act on it.

## Preconditions

- A `docs/current_work/ideas/` directory exists (created by `sdlc-initialize`). If absent, create it before writing.
- The session has produced enough context to describe the handoff. Don't capture handoffs based on a single line of conversation — wait until the issue or idea has been examined enough to articulate concretely.

## Workflow

```
CAPTURE INTENT → EXTRACT EVIDENCE → CLASSIFY & RECOMMEND → GENERATE SLUG → WRITE DOC → SURFACE NEXT STEP → (OPTIONAL) COMMIT
```

## Steps

### 1. Capture Intent

If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, use it as the seed. Otherwise prompt the user with `AskUserQuestion`:

> "What's being handed off?" (free-text answer)

Then classify the trigger using `AskUserQuestion`:

| Option | When to choose |
|--------|----------------|
| **Issue / bug** | A defect or regression — code is broken or behaving wrong |
| **Idea / improvement** | A new feature, refactor, or improvement worth exploring |
| **Deferred work** | Already-clear work the user agreed to do later |
| **Investigation needed** | An unknown that needs focused digging in a fresh session |

The trigger type determines which next-skill recommendation is most likely to fit (see step 3).

### 2. Extract Evidence

Pull from the current session — do NOT re-investigate. The handoff doc is a capture of what's already known, not an opportunity to expand the search.

Collect:

- **Files touched or read in this session** — paths to specific files involved
- **Code locations** — `file:line` references for any bug, anomaly, or salient code already encountered
- **Error output** — verbatim stack traces, error messages, log lines from this session
- **Recent agent findings** — any agent reports or review findings that bear on the handoff
- **Observations from the user** — what they noticed, in their own words where possible
- **Active deliverable context** — if a deliverable is in flight, name its ID and state so the receiving session knows what NOT to disturb

LSP (`hover`, `findReferences`) is allowed only to confirm symbol names and line numbers already discussed. The handoff captures; it does not explore. If you find yourself reading new files or running new searches, stop — that's the receiving session's job.

### 3. Classify and Recommend a Next Skill

Pick the lightest skill that won't skip a needed gate. Note the reasoning in the doc — the receiving session may override.

| Handoff trigger + shape | Default next skill | Rationale |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Issue — well-isolated, single-file fix | Direct dispatch (`debug-specialist` or relevant specialist) | Single-agent fix doesn't need a plan |
| Issue — cross-domain or unclear scope | `sdlc-lite-plan` | Worth a reviewed plan before fixing |
| Issue — production incident with user impact | `sdlc-debug-incident` | Live triage and postmortem required |
| Idea — vague or unscoped | `sdlc-idea` | Needs exploration before planning |
| Idea — clear shape | `sdlc-lite-plan` or `sdlc-plan` | Skip exploration if requirements are evident |
| Deferred work — small, well-defined | Direct dispatch | Just do it when picked up |
| Deferred work — non-trivial | `sdlc-lite-plan` | Plan first |
| Investigation needed | `sdlc-idea` | Open-ended exploration is the point |

If multiple skills could fit equally, list them in the doc and let the receiving session choose.

### 4. Generate a Slug

Two-to-four words, kebab-case, descriptive of the handoff itself (not the source session). Examples:

- `auth-token-refresh-bug`
- `query-cache-investigation`
- `deferred-typescript-strict-mode`

If a collision exists in `docs/current_work/ideas/`, append a date suffix: `{slug}-YYYY-MM-DD`.

### 5. Write the Handoff Doc

Write to `docs/current_work/ideas/{slug}_handoff.md` using this structure:

```markdown
---
type: handoff
slug: {slug}
created: YYYY-MM-DD
status: pending
trigger: {issue | idea | deferred-work | investigation}
recommended_next_skill: {skill-name or "direct-dispatch"}
source_session_summary: "{one line: what the source session was working on}"
active_deliverable: {DNN or null}
related_files:
  - path/to/file.ts
  - path/to/other.py
---

# Handoff: {Title}

## Why this is a handoff
{1-2 paragraphs: what was found in the current session and why it shouldn't be handled here. Name the source session's actual focus so the receiving session knows what NOT to inherit.}

## What needs to happen
{The work being handed off. Be specific where possible; it's fine to leave shape questions open — the receiving skill will sharpen them. Bullets or paragraphs, whichever fits.}

## Evidence
- **Code locations:** `path/to/file.ts:47` — {what's at that line}
- **Error output:** {paste verbatim, or reference a captured log file if long}
- **Observations:** {what the user or agent noticed, ideally with attribution}
- **Related findings:** {agent reports, review notes, prior chronicle entries}

## Recommended next step
Open a new session and run: **`/{recommended-skill}`** with this file as the seed.

Reasoning: {one or two sentences on why this skill fits — the receiving session may choose differently}

## Open questions
- {what the receiving session will need to figure out}
- {ambiguity worth flagging up front}

## Out of scope (do NOT pursue)
{Anything tangentially relevant that could pull the receiving session off track. Optional but useful when the handoff sits adjacent to a larger area.}
```

Validate before saving:

- Every required string field in the frontmatter is populated — no leftover `{placeholder}` markers. (`active_deliverable: null` is a valid sentinel value when no deliverable is in flight; do not treat that as unfilled.)
- Evidence section has at least one concrete reference (file path, line number, or verbatim error). A handoff with no evidence is a TODO, not a handoff.
- Recommended next skill names a real, installed skill (or `direct-dispatch`).

### 6. Surface the Handoff

Output to the user (plain text, not a question):

```
Handoff written: docs/current_work/ideas/{slug}_handoff.md

To pick this up in a new session:
  /clear
  /{recommended-skill} pick up the handoff at docs/current_work/ideas/{slug}_handoff.md

Or invoke the skill with the file as the seed in any way that matches your workflow.
```

Do NOT auto-clear the current session. The user decides when to context-switch.

### 7. Commit (optional)

If the project commits SDLC docs and the user wants the handoff visible across branches or to teammates, ask via `AskUserQuestion` whether to commit it now. Suggested message:

```
docs: add {slug} handoff
```

If not committing, point out that the file is on disk but uncommitted — a session on a different branch won't see it.

## Output

- `docs/current_work/ideas/{slug}_handoff.md` — the handoff doc
- (Optional) Git commit adding the doc
- A clear next-step message for the user

## Validation Criteria

Before completing the skill, verify:

- The doc exists at the expected path
- Every required string field in the frontmatter is populated (no `{placeholder}` markers; `active_deliverable: null` is acceptable when no deliverable is active)
- The Evidence section has at least one concrete reference
- The Recommended next step names a real, installed skill or `direct-dispatch`
- The doc reads cold — a reader who hasn't seen this session can act on it

If any check fails, fix the doc before reporting completion.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll just leave a TODO comment in the code instead" | TODOs rot. A handoff is a tracked artifact that surfaces in `sdlc-status`-adjacent scans and gets resolved in `sdlc-archive`. Use the doc. |
| "The new session will read this conversation, I don't need to capture context" | The receiving session won't have this conversation. Capture every detail the receiver needs — file paths, error text, verbatim observations. |
| "I'll write a one-paragraph handoff and let the receiver figure it out" | Handoffs without evidence are worse than no handoff — they look like work but force the receiver to redo discovery. Either capture real evidence or don't write the handoff. |
| "I'll re-investigate to make the handoff thorough" | The handoff captures what's already known. Don't expand the investigation — that's the receiving session's job. Re-investigation is how this skill ends up duplicating `sdlc-idea`. |
| "I'll handle this in the current session, it's small" | If it would derail the current task, it's a handoff. The cost of context-switching mid-task is real and underestimated. |
| "I'll skip the recommended-next-skill field, the user can choose" | Always recommend. The receiver may override, but the recommendation forces you to think about which gate the work needs. |
| "I'll auto-clear the session after writing" | The user controls context switches. Surface the next-step command and stop. |
| "Multiple handoffs from one session can share a doc" | One handoff = one doc. Bundling makes the receiver disentangle them. Write separate docs. |
| "I'll write this as an idea brief instead" | Idea briefs are produced by `sdlc-idea` AFTER exploration. Handoffs are pre-exploration session captures. Different artifacts, different filenames (`*_idea-brief.md` vs `*_handoff.md`). |
| "The handoff doc is for me — terse notes are fine" | The handoff is for a future session that has zero shared context. Write for that reader. Telegraphic notes that depend on this conversation are worthless to the receiver. |
| "I'll skip Step 7 (Commit) — the user didn't ask for it" | The commit step is gated by `AskUserQuestion` for a reason: a handoff that lives only on the source-session branch is invisible to a session on `main` or another branch. Always ask. The user decides; you don't decide for them by skipping. |

## Integration

- **Depends on:** Active session context (files touched, agent findings, observations); `docs/current_work/ideas/` directory (auto-created if missing).
- **Feeds into:** `sdlc-idea` (exploration of an unscoped handoff), `sdlc-lite-plan` (lightweight planning), `sdlc-plan` (full planning), `sdlc-debug-incident` (active incidents), direct dispatch (single-agent fixes), `sdlc-archive` (resolves handoffs to chronicle).
- **Uses:** `AskUserQuestion` for trigger classification and commit confirmation; `LSP`/`Grep` for quick reference confirmation only (no expanded investigation); `Write` for the doc.
- **Complements:** `sdlc-resume` (picks up an existing deliverable; this skill creates a new starting point for unscoped work); `sdlc-status` (surfaces pending handoffs alongside active deliverables when invoked).
- **Does NOT replace:** `sdlc-idea` — handoffs are session captures, not exploration output. `sdlc-debug-incident` — active production incidents need the incident skill directly, not a handoff routed through it. `sdlc-plan` / `sdlc-lite-plan` — handoffs name the work; planning skills scope it.
- **DRY notes:** The `*_handoff.md` filename and `docs/current_work/ideas/` location are already canonical conventions used by `sdlc-archive` (which handles archival of resolved handoffs). This skill produces the artifact; `sdlc-archive` cleans it up. Do not invent a parallel directory.
