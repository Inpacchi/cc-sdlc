"""The CI tier's launcher: one disposable runner per job (z-sdlc process/factory.md, Enablement step 10, The CI tier).

Usage: python3 -I ci_launcher.py run <launcher.json> <slot>     one cycle; the slot's systemd unit starts the next
       python3 -I ci_launcher.py stop <launcher.json> <slot>    after a slot stops: its container and registration
       python3 -I ci_launcher.py resolve <launcher.json>        the App's installation and the runner group's IDs
       python3 -I ci_launcher.py check <launcher.json>          the tier's isolation check; on failure, its kill switch
       python3 -I ci_launcher.py fwcheck <launcher.json>        the firewall table alone (every minute)
       python3 -I ci_launcher.py trip <launcher.json>           the kill switch, for a check that failed or hung
       python3 -I ci_launcher.py fingerprint <table>            the firewall table's fingerprint (setup records it)
       python3 -I ci_launcher.py inputs <dir> [<arg>...]           the job image's build inputs' fingerprint
       python3 -I ci_launcher.py busy <launcher.json> <slot>    exit 0 when the slot's runner is running a job (or GitHub
                                                                can't say), 1 when setup may restart the slot

A cycle mints a just-in-time (JIT) runner config with the runner-registration App. The App's one permission, the
organization's self-hosted runners, reaches every runner group in the organization, so its key (root-only, read by
openssl alone) is the most sensitive thing on the host. The cycle starts a fresh container from the tier's image
as the runner user and watches it until its one job ends. GitHub, never the daemon, says whether the runner is
online and busy, and the container is killed when:
- its job has run CI_JOB_HOURS (the job's own timeout-minutes is the first limit; this is the backstop);
- its runner has idled CI_IDLE_HOURS (recycled);
- GitHub has removed its runner (the job is over), its runner went offline after being online, or its runner
  never came online;
- it is older than CI_IDLE_HOURS + CI_JOB_HOURS, whatever GitHub says;
- the runner home's free space falls below CI_MIN_FREE_GB (and no cycle starts below it).
While GitHub can't be read (an outage, a revoked key), the gone, offline, never-online, idle and job-hours limits all
wait on an answer: the lifetime cap and the disk floor are what bound a container then.
Then it removes the container and the runner's registration. The job runs inside the container, runner and all:
whatever a pull request's code does there, to the runner's own processes included, ends with the container.

Root-side rules (the job owns its container, so root trusts nothing that comes out of it):
- root reads one thing from the daemon, `docker wait`'s exit status, and only as an integer; containers are
  addressed by the names this script gives them, never by an ID the daemon returns. The check's probes answer
  with their exit status; their output is only logged, as printable ASCII;
- the installation token lives only in this process. The JIT config reaches the container through a 0600 file the
  runner user owns, created in a directory only root can write and deleted once `docker run` returns. Inside the
  container it stays readable to the job (run.sh's environment, the container's config) until the container is
  removed: it is single-use, and registers only the runner the job is already running on;
- every docker call runs as the runner user with a fixed environment and a timeout, never as root. setpriv execs
  docker (runuser would fork a parent that a timeout kills, orphaning docker).
A container escape is a compromise of the runner user, held by the outer boundary: its own user, the firewall,
the caps. Tested by tests/test_ci_launcher.py.
