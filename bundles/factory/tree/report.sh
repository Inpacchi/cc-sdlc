# What the report jobs do around posting an agent's result as the factory App: factory-implement.yml's
# and factory-plan.yml's report jobs and factory-triage.yml's apply job, on a GitHub-hosted runner, from
# the default branch. The text filters are in report.jq.
# Usage: report.sh <command> [args]
#
#   check <stage> <result.json> <fields>
#                  refuse to post (exit 1) when any of <fields>, a jq expression giving the strings the
#                  job posts (for example '[.reason, .questions[]]'), holds a credential-like string, an
#                  image or an embed
#   labels <new> [fable|none]
#                  make <new> (a factory:* state label, or empty for none) the issue's only state label;
#                  factory:advisor, factory:follow-up and factory:go are properties and stay. fable adds
#                  factory:advisor, none removes it.
# Environment: ISSUE_NUMBER; GH_TOKEN and GH_REPO for labels.
# Tested in CI by tests/test_report.py.
