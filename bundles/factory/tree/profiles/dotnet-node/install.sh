# dotnet-node profile: install the project's dependencies before the agent runs, outside the sandbox
# (implement's sandbox has no network at all). Run by agent_job.sh workspace from the frozen copy, in
# the workspace, after the test services start and after any secret is out of the environment: this
# runs the project's dependency manifests.
# Usage: install.sh <dotnet-dir> <node-dir>
#   <dotnet-dir> (its solution or project, and its local tools) gets `dotnet restore`; <node-dir>
#   gets `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

# compiler server may outlive a command, and nothing on first run writes outside the workspace
# (telemetry, the HTTPS development certificate). NuGet's audit needs the network: it runs here,
# and is off in the sandbox, where a restore can only work from these packages.
