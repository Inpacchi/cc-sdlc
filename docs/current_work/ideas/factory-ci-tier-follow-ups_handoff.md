# The factory CI tier and runner audit: follow-ups after v2.1.0

The pilot project's release reviews (rounds 1 to 3, 2026-10-15) passed these as minor, to follow the tag. Each says what's wrong, what it costs, and where to start. Fixes go in the bundle (`bundles/factory/tree/`) and then to the incubator with `zsdlc-import-factory --to-incubator`.

## The CI launcher (`host/ci_launcher.py`)

1. **A registration can leak when SIGTERM lands inside `generate-jitconfig`.** GitHub has registered the runner, but the cycle hasn't recorded its ID yet, so neither the cycle's cleanup nor the slot's stop knows to remove it. It stays registered and offline until GitHub ages it out, and the audit counts it against the CI group's most-at-once in the meantime. Start: record a pending marker before the call, and on stop, list the group's runners by the slot's name prefix to find one with no record.
2. **Excess slots are removed without asking whether they're busy.** Lowering `CI_RUNNERS` makes setup `disable --now` every slot above the new count, which kills a job one of them is running. Start: `retire` each one first, and leave a busy one running until its job ends, then disable it.
3. **The image build directory can leak, and old images are removed in the wrong order.** A build that fails leaves its root-only build directory behind. Setup also removes old images before it knows the new one works. Start: clean the build directory in a trap, and remove old images only after the gate's check passes on the new one.
4. **`record_files()` skips a loose old-state directory silently.** It reads `/run/factory-runner/<unit>` only when that directory passes the root-only check, and swallows the check's failure. So `retire` can answer idle while a record there goes unread. Only root can loosen it. Start: in `retire`, an old-state directory that exists but fails the check answers not idle; the cycle can keep skipping it.
5. **A 404 from the wrong organization reads as "gone".** `retire` and the leftover sweep take a 404 on a runner to mean it's already removed. GitHub also answers 404 for an organization the App can't see, so a misconfigured `org` makes `retire` answer idle. Start: trust a 404 only after the organization's runner list has answered 200 in the same call.
6. **The pre-release migration code has no sunset.** `record_files()`'s old `/run` path and `setup-ci.sh`'s carry-over loop serve only hosts upgrading from a pre-release CI tier. Remove both in the release after v2.1.0, once every such host has run v2.1.0's setup and `CI_IDLE_HOURS` + `CI_JOB_HOURS` have passed since, or the host has rebooted (`/run` is tmpfs).

## Host setup (`host/setup.sh`, `host/setup-ci.sh`)

7. **A strict-tier runner can be left stopped when an upgrade's download fails.** Setup stops an idle runner before unpacking a `RUNNER_VERSION` bump. If the download then fails, setup dies and the runner stays stopped until the next run. Start: download and verify first, then stop and unpack.
8. **The label rules live in four places:**
   - `setup.sh`'s refusal of a tier without a label of its own;
   - `ci_launcher.py`'s `SELF_HOSTED_DEFAULTS`, which `jit_labels()` uses;
   - `runner_audit.py`'s `DEFAULT_LABELS_OF_RUNNERS`;
   - the docs.

   They agree today. Start: one list in a file the scripts all read, with a test that the docs name the same labels.
9. **Enablement doesn't say the factory drops GitHub's default labels.** GitHub adds `self-hosted`, the OS and the architecture to every self-hosted runner, and the launcher and the audit both drop them by name. Enablement doesn't say so, so an operator reading a runner's labels in GitHub's UI can't tell which ones the factory set. Start: a line in step 10.

## The firewall check

10. **An `nftables` upgrade can change the table's fingerprint.** The check already fingerprints `nft -j`'s JSON (chains, rules, set elements), not the printed text. The risk left is that JSON's shape changing across `nft` versions: new fields, or a different order, would read as drift and trip the tier. That fails safe, but it looks like an attack. Start: a note in Enablement step 10's recovery steps (run setup again after an `nftables` upgrade, which records a new fingerprint), or a fingerprint of only the fields that matter.

## The runner audit (`runner_audit.py`)

11. **A malformed answer from GitHub can raise `TypeError` in `check`.** It isn't in `main()`'s handled exceptions, so it prints a traceback and exits 1 (drift) rather than 2 (couldn't read). The run still fails and alerts, but under the wrong name. Start: validate each field's type where it's read, or add `TypeError` and `KeyError` to the tuple.
12. **The audit doesn't read the organization's audit log** (parked by CD, 2026-10-15: the factory runs without it for now). Anything done and undone between two hourly runs goes unseen: a runner that takes one job and goes, or a group opened for one job and restored. The audit log's REST API (`GET orgs/<org>/audit-log`, on GitHub Enterprise Cloud) records both. What's known so far:
    - **The shape CD chose:** alarm when the CI tier's runner-registration App registers or removes a runner outside the CI tier's group, or changes any runner group, read from the audit log since the last run.
    - **The permission:** GitHub's docs list the endpoint under the organization's "Administration" permission (read), for App installation tokens too, not under "Self-hosted runners". The auditor App would need both. That's still read-only, but it can read the organization's settings too, which step 12 should say. Not yet tested: a 200 from `GET orgs/<org>/audit-log?phrase=action:org.register_self_hosted_runner&per_page=1` with the auditor's installation token settles it; a 403 means an owner's classic token with `read:audit_log`, which changes the design.
    - **Seen working:** an organization owner's token answers 200 and records `org.register_self_hosted_runner`.

    Start: `create_app.py --auditor` requests Administration read too, `runner_audit.py` reads the log since the last run (kept as the last event's cursor), and Enablement step 12 says what the wider permission reads.
13. **A renamed group reads as one gone and one new.** Groups are keyed `<name>#<id>`, so a rename reports two drifts that look worse than what happened. Start: match an unexpected key to a missing one by ID, and report a rename.

## Tests

14. **The real-Docker smoke test pulls from Docker Hub.** `FACTORY_DOCKER_SMOKE=1` pulls a base image on each run, which is slow and can hit Docker Hub's rate limit, and the test then fails for a reason unrelated to the job flags. Start: build the smoke image `FROM scratch` with a static binary, or skip with a clear message when the pull fails.
