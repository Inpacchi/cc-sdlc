# Architecture Discipline

**Status**: Active — backend capability assessment

## Scope

System design, component boundaries, integration patterns, technology choices, cross-project patterns. Assessing what a backend currently supports and estimating the cost of adding capabilities that unlock desired feature scope.

## Backend Capability Assessment

**When to invoke:** After competitive analysis produces a scoped feature definition with open questions, and before UX modeling finalizes the design. The backend assessment bridges "what should we build?" with "what CAN we build?"

**What it produces:**
- Backend inventory summary (API surface, database, services, auth, existing patterns)
- Capability matrix mapping feature dimensions to support levels (Supported / Partial / New / Infrastructure)
- Cost estimates with T-shirt sizing and dependency chains
- Scope recommendation organized by effort tier (ship now, quick wins, significant investment, revisit later)

**How to use the output:** Map each effort tier back to the competitive analysis scoping questions. This gives the product owner cost-aware information to adjust scope decisions.

**Knowledge store:** `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/` (see inventory below)

**Pipeline position:**
```
/feature-compare → scope questions → product owner picks target scope
  ↓
/backend-assess → capability matrix, cost estimates    ← THIS
  ↓
/ux-model → IA, wireframes, specs (informed by what's feasible)
  ↓
spec → plan → implement
```

- **Advisory lock + connection pooling release locks silently.** Promoted → `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/domain-boundary-gotchas.yaml` (advisory-lock-pool-release entry)
- **Lazy initialization needs a short-circuit for tests.** Promoted → `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/domain-boundary-gotchas.yaml` (lazy-init-test-shortcircuit entry)
- **"Metadata-only" flags don't gate behavior — until they do.** Promoted → `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/domain-boundary-gotchas.yaml` (metadata-only-flag-drift entry)

### Model & Effort Tiering (2026-07-08, source: r/ClaudeAI community threads + community "fable-chief-agent" skill)

*Bulk import from community tiered-orchestration discussion. Validated, generalizable rules were promoted directly to `[sdlc-root]/knowledge/architecture/model-tier-strategy.yaml` (MTS1–MTS6); the entries below need validation before promotion.*

- **Per-agent `effort:` frontmatter support matrix.** [NEEDS VALIDATION] Community reports per-subagent effort (`low` through `max`) in agent frontmatter overriding session effort, with recon roles at low effort "nearly free quality-wise." Verify which Claude Code versions support the field and confirm the accepted value set (low | medium | high | xhigh | max) before projects rely on it. (Source: r/ClaudeAI effort-frontmatter thread, 2026-07 screenshot)
- **Sonnet-tier workers thrash on Rust codebases.** [NEEDS VALIDATION] One practitioner reports Sonnet "struggles with Rust codebases then drowns in tool calls" while performing well on frontend work. If reproduced, Rust-heavy projects should default implementer agents to opus-tier or add a stack note at initialization. Recheck per model release. (Source: r/ClaudeAI tiered-workflow thread, 2026-07 screenshot)
- **Per-phase Model/Effort column in plan templates.** [NEEDS VALIDATION] Plans assign agents per phase; the agent's frontmatter carries the tier. An explicit per-phase Model/Effort override column in `planning_template.md` would let the planning agent encode MTS4 escalations in the artifact instead of relying on dispatch-time judgment — but adds template weight. Trial on a high-risk deliverable first. (Source: this ingestion's gap analysis)
