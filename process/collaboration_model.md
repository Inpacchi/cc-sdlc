# CD/CC Collaboration Model

## Roles

### CD (Claude Director / Human)
The human collaborator who:
- Sets direction and priorities
- Writes or approves specifications
- Makes architectural decisions
- Reviews proposals and results
- Resolves ambiguity

### CC (Claude Code)
The AI collaborator who:
- Proposes approaches and designs
- Implements features and fixes
- Asks clarifying questions
- Documents work and decisions
- Maintains project memory through chronicles

## Communication Patterns

### Tool Rule: AskUserQuestion for All Questions

**Every question directed at the user MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool.** Do not type questions as conversational text — they get buried in output and are easy to miss. This applies to:
- DECIDE findings during review triage
- Clarification requests about requirements
- Progress updates that need a decision (e.g., "Option A or B?")
- Escalations (review-loop round cap, 3-strike rule, unresolvable findings)
- Any moment where you need user input before proceeding

Status updates, completion reports, and informational output that do NOT require a response should be typed as normal text. The one approval asked without the tool is spec and plan approval: the Approval Brief message ends the turn, and CD's reply is the answer (`[sdlc-root]/process/writing-for-cd.md` § Approval Briefs).

### 1. Proposal-First

CC should propose before executing significant work:

**CC:** "I'd like to implement X by doing Y. This will affect files A, B, C. Does this approach work?"

**CD:** "Yes, proceed" or "Actually, let's try Z instead"

### 2. Clarification Requests

When requirements are ambiguous, use `AskUserQuestion`:

**CC:** *(via AskUserQuestion)* "The spec mentions 'user authentication' but doesn't specify OAuth vs password. Which approach should I use?"

### 3. Progress Updates

For longer tasks that hit a decision point, use `AskUserQuestion`:

**CC:** *(via AskUserQuestion)* "Completed steps 1-3. Found an issue with step 4 — the API doesn't support X. Options: (a) work around it, (b) modify the spec. Which do you prefer?"

For status-only updates with no decision needed, use normal text.

### 4. Completion Reports

When work is done (no question — normal text), the report leads with what CD needs and stays plain (`[sdlc-root]/process/writing-for-cd.md`). A deliverable ends with the Completion Report in `sdlc-execute` / `sdlc-lite-execute` step 5. Smaller work ends in a few sentences:

**CC:** "Done: the session now refreshes itself, so users stay signed in past an hour. I checked it by signing in and waiting out the old timeout; the 12 auth tests pass. Nothing for you to do."

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority |
|--------------|-----------|
| What to build | CD |
| How to build (approach) | CC proposes, CD approves |
| Implementation details | CC |
| Architectural patterns | CD (or CC with approval) |
| Data visibility (what users see) | CD |
| Scope changes | CD |
| When to ship/merge | CD |

---

## Context Management

### Starting a Session
CC should check:
1. `CLAUDE.md` for project context
2. `current_work/specs/` for active deliverables
3. `current_work/issues/` for blockers
4. Recent commits for recent changes

### During Work
CC maintains context through:
- Reading relevant specs and planning docs
- Checking `_index.md` in concept chronicles
- Asking CD when context is unclear

### Ending a Session
For long-running work, CC should:
- Document current state
- Note any pending decisions
- Update relevant specs/results

## Workflow Design Rationale

The plan→execute workflow is structured around context window management. These principles explain *why* the workflow works the way it does — not just what it does.

### Context Clearing Between Phases

Each phase (spec, plan, execute) should start with a fresh context window. LLM performance degrades as the context fills with tool outputs, file reads, and conversation history. Clearing between phases ensures execution happens with only the approved plan as input, not accumulated noise from the planning process. The plan file is the compaction artifact — it compresses all research and decisions into a document that a fresh context can act on immediately.

### Domain Agents as Context Isolation

Dispatching work to domain agents is a context management strategy. Each agent gets a clean context window loaded with only the domain knowledge and files relevant to its task. A backend-developer agent doesn't load design knowledge, accessibility rules, or frontend component patterns — its context stays focused on backend concerns. This keeps each agent operating in a focused, high-signal context rather than a broad, noisy one. The domain scoping (specific files, specific knowledge, specific concerns) is what makes the isolation effective.

### On-Demand Research Over Static Documentation

The spec phase investigates the codebase live rather than relying on pre-written architectural documentation. Code is the source of truth; documentation drifts. On-demand research compresses the actual current state of the code into a spec — a snapshot of truth derived from the code itself, not a cached understanding that may be stale.

### Rigor Gradient

Match process overhead to task complexity. The trigger is complexity of decisions, not file count.

| Complexity | Approach |
|---|---|
| Trivial (config change, typo fix) | Direct implementation, no plan |
| Moderate (multi-step, cross-domain, non-obvious approach) | `sdlc-lite-plan` → `sdlc-lite-execute` |
| Significant (new feature, new integration, architectural change) | `sdlc-plan` → `sdlc-execute` |

A 2-file change touching real-time + database warrants a lite plan. A 10-file rename refactor might not. Judge by the complexity of the decisions involved.

### Plan Review as Mental Alignment

As AI-generated code throughput increases, plan review becomes the primary mechanism for maintaining shared understanding of how the codebase is evolving. CD reads plans to stay aligned on approach and intent. This is more efficient than reviewing hundreds of lines of generated code after the fact. Plans compress intent — a reviewer can assess correctness at the approach level before any code is written, catching architectural missteps that would be expensive to fix post-implementation.

### Estimation Model

**Do not estimate in cardinal time.** Traditional time estimates (hours, days, sprints) assume a solo developer working from scratch. AI-assisted development compresses implementation timelines so dramatically that calendar-time estimates are misleading — what would take a solo developer two weeks can be developed and iterated in 1–3 days with AI-driven workflows. Time estimates anchored to pre-AI development create false expectations in both directions: they overestimate how long implementation takes and underestimate how much iteration is needed to get it right.

Estimate deliverables on three dimensions instead:

| Dimension | What It Measures | Scale |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Validity** | Is this the right thing to build? How confident are we that the requirements are correct and complete? | Low / Medium / High |
| **Correctness** | How likely is the implementation to be correct on the first pass? Accounts for domain complexity, edge cases, subtle invariants, and integration surface area. | Low / Medium / High |
| **Effort** | How many human–AI coordination cycles will this require? Accounts for review rounds, iteration on feedback, cross-domain handoffs, and verification depth — not wall-clock time. | Light / Moderate / Heavy |

**How the dimensions interact:**

- **High validity + High correctness + Light effort** → Direct dispatch or SDLC-Lite. Requirements are clear, the domain is well-understood, and the implementation path is straightforward.
- **Low validity** → Invest in the spec phase. The risk is building the wrong thing, not building it slowly. `sdlc-idea` or extended discovery before committing to a plan.
- **Low correctness** → Invest in testing and review. The implementation will need multiple iteration cycles. Plan for heavier agent review, edge-case testing, and possibly a spike phase.
- **Heavy effort** → Full SDLC with phased execution. Many coordination cycles means many opportunities for drift — the plan artifact keeps everyone aligned across context clears.

**Why not time?** A deliverable with High validity, High correctness, and Light effort might take 30 minutes. The same deliverable with Low correctness (subtle concurrency bugs, complex state management) might take the same 30 minutes of AI-driven implementation but 2 days of iteration to get right. The implementation time is identical — the iteration time is what varies, and iteration time is driven by correctness risk, not by the size of the feature.

Not all tasks require the same level of human oversight. The CD/CC model is not binary (direct vs. execute) — it operates on a spectrum calibrated to the risk and reversibility of the work.

| Level | Name | CC Behavior | CD Involvement | When |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------|------|
| **1** | **Full autonomy** | CC implements and commits without checking in | CD reviews async (PR review, result doc) | Bug fixes with clear reproduction, config changes, lint/format fixes, dependency patches |
| **2** | **Guided autonomy** | CC proposes approach, implements after implicit approval (no objection) | CD sets direction, reviews output | Well-scoped tasks within established patterns, test writing, documentation |
| **3** | **Collaborative** | CC proposes approach, waits for explicit approval before implementing | CD approves approach, reviews implementation | Multi-file features, new integrations, changes touching multiple domains |
| **4** | **Directed** | CC presents options with tradeoffs, CD chooses, CC implements | CD makes design decisions, CC executes | Architectural changes, data model changes, API contract changes |
| **5** | **Supervised** | CC explores via subagent with bounded scope, presents findings for CD decision | CD drives every significant decision | Security-critical changes, irreversible migrations, payment/PII flows |

**Calibration heuristic:** Match autonomy level to the *cost of getting it wrong*. A typo fix costs nothing to revert (level 1). A database migration costs hours to undo (level 5). When in doubt, err toward lower autonomy — the cost of asking is low, the cost of an unwanted action can be high.

**Subagent-bounded exploration (Level 5):** For high-risk domains, CC should explore options via subagents rather than accumulating exploration in the main context. The subagent returns a summary of findings; CD decides the direction; CC implements in a fresh context. This prevents both context pollution and premature commitment to an approach.

**Dynamic adjustment:** Autonomy level can shift within a session. A task may start at level 3 (new feature, need to agree on approach) and shift to level 2 once the approach is approved and CC is implementing within established patterns. CD can explicitly adjust: "you're good, just run with it" (shift up) or "hold on, let me see each step" (shift down).

## Anti-Patterns

### CD Anti-Patterns
- Giving vague instructions ("make it better")
- Changing requirements mid-implementation without discussion
- Approving specs without reading them

### CC Anti-Patterns
- Implementing before confirming approach
- Making architectural decisions without asking
- Making data exclusion decisions without surfacing them (e.g., stripping fields from indexes to meet size limits — this silently breaks downstream features that depend on that data)
- Ignoring existing patterns in the codebase
- Over-engineering beyond requirements
- **Code assertion without verification** — answering factual questions about how specific code behaves without reading the code first. Most common during conversational interludes after a structured skill completes, where PRE/POST-GATE enforcement is absent. The correct sequence is always: grep/read → reason → answer. If the question is "when does X happen" or "how does Y work", never assert specific code behavior from memory or context alone.
- **Trajectory poisoning** — repeatedly correcting the agent in the same context window instead of starting fresh. After 2-3 corrections, the conversation trajectory becomes "CC does something wrong → CD corrects → CC does something wrong again." The LLM treats this trajectory as the expected pattern and continues producing errors. If the agent is off track after 2-3 corrections, clear the context and start a new session with better initial guidance rather than continuing to correct in a poisoned trajectory.

> **Data visibility** includes decisions to exclude, transform, or omit fields from indexes, caches, or API responses — anything that changes what data reaches the frontend. These are product decisions, not implementation details, because they affect what users can see and do.
