# Guardrail Lifecycle

How recurring review findings graduate into **mechanized guards** — lint rules, drift tests, CI checks — and how those guards are kept honest afterward. This is a cross-skill contract: `sdlc-review-code` logs patterns, `sdlc-reflect` and `sdlc-audit` propose promotions, CD approves at triage, and every review-fix loop treats guard modification as in-scope work. A guard is never set once and forgotten — each audit cycle re-evaluates whether it still fires, still matches its pattern, and still earns its place.

## The Loop

```
LOG → THRESHOLD → PROMOTE → ENFORCE → RE-EVALUATE → MODIFY or RETIRE
```

1. **Log** — `sdlc-review-code` Step 6 clusters review findings into `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml`.
2. **Threshold** — `sdlc-audit` Dimension 6l scans clusters for 3+ occurrences in the sliding window; `sdlc-reflect` runs the same scan session-scoped between audits. Neither redefines the threshold — 6l's numbers are canonical.
3. **Promote** — at audit triage (compliance methodology step 11), CD decides per candidate: promote to knowledge store, promote to a mechanized guard, both, defer, or dismiss. Knowledge promotion teaches agents; guard promotion makes the machine catch the next occurrence. A pattern that keeps recurring *after* knowledge promotion is the strongest guard-promotion signal — the agents were told and it still happened.
4. **Enforce** — the project implements the guard and the cluster records it in its `mechanized_guard` field (schema below).
5. **Re-evaluate** — `sdlc-audit` Dimension 6n checks every recorded guard's freshness on each audit cycle.
6. **Modify or retire** — review-fix loops treat guard updates as in-scope fixes; guards flagged ineffective by 6n are fixed or retired through triage, never silently ignored.

## Division of Labor

The framework defines the loop, the schema, and the audit checks. **The project supplies the guards themselves** — the actual lint rules, drift tests, and CI wiring. cc-sdlc never ships project-specific rules; it ships the contract that makes their absence, staleness, or ineffectiveness visible.

## The `mechanized_guard` Field

When CD approves guard promotion, add this field to the cluster in `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml` (schema owner: `sdlc-review-code` Step 6):

```yaml
    mechanized_guard:
      type: {lint-rule|drift-test|ci-check|pre-commit-hook|type-constraint|other}
      location: "{where the guard lives — rule ID, test file path, CI job/step name, hook script}"
      created: YYYY-MM-DD
      notes: "{optional — suppression mechanism, known blind spots}"
```

`location` must be specific enough for Dimension 6n to verify the guard still exists *and still enforces*: an ESLint rule name in a named config file, a test file path, a CI job and step. "We added a lint rule" without a locator fails the freshness check by construction.

A cluster can carry both `knowledge_entry` (knowledge promotion) and `mechanized_guard` (guard promotion) — the two paths are complementary, not exclusive. `promoted: true` continues to mean knowledge promotion only; a guard-only cluster keeps `promoted: false` with a `mechanized_guard` field.

## Assessed and Excluded — "Do Not Re-Propose"

Some patterns clear the occurrence threshold but should not be mechanized — the manifestations are heterogeneous, the guard would need semantics that don't exist, or the noise cost outweighs the catch rate. Dismissing such a candidate at triage is not enough: without a durable record, 6l and reflect re-propose it every cycle and CD re-dismisses forever. Record the decision on the cluster:

```yaml
    mechanization_assessed: excluded
    mechanization_reason: "{why the pattern resists mechanization or isn't worth it — recorded at triage}"
```

Semantics:

- **Set only by CD decision at triage.** Exclude is distinct from defer: defer means "re-propose next cycle"; exclude means "assessed, deliberately not mechanized, stop proposing."
- **6l and reflect skip excluded clusters** in guard-candidate output. They still report the excluded count (with reasons available) so the decision stays audit-visible — skipped is not hidden.
- **Guards only.** Exclusion says nothing about knowledge promotion — an excluded cluster can still be (or become) a knowledge-promotion candidate.
- **Reversible at triage.** If the pattern's manifestations later converge on a mechanizable signature, CD clears the fields at triage and the cluster re-enters normal candidate flow. New occurrences alone do not reopen the question — they accumulate on the cluster as usual and appear in the info-tier excluded listing, where CD can choose to revisit.

## What Qualifies for Guard Promotion

A pattern is **mechanizable** when its next occurrence could be detected without human judgment:

| Signature | Guard type | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Textual — a string or regex marks the defect | lint-rule, pre-commit-hook, ci-check | `KEEP IN SYNC` comments; banned APIs; hardcoded env names |
| Structural — an AST or type-level shape marks it | lint-rule, type-constraint | missing `useShallow` on a zustand selector; untyped catch clauses |
| Behavioral — a test can fail when it happens | drift-test, ci-check | parallel copies diverging; schema/client drift; broken invariants |

Patterns requiring judgment — naming quality, over-abstraction, unclear ownership — are **not** mechanizable; they take the knowledge-promotion path only. When proposing candidates, say which signature applies; "we could probably lint this" without naming the signature is not a proposal.

## Guard Freshness (audit Dimension 6n)

For each cluster with a `mechanized_guard` field, `sdlc-audit` checks:

| Check | Signal | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Guard exists and enforces** | `location` resolves AND enforcement is effective — presence of the rule-name string in config is not enough. Lint rules: parse the *effective* severity (`off` = not wired; `warn` = advisory unless `notes` documents that as intended); conditional registration (e.g., `plugin.rules["x"] ? {...} : {}`) must be evaluated for runtime collapse, not text-grepped. Tests: a skipped test enforces nothing. CI: a disabled or continue-on-error step enforces nothing. When static reading is inconclusive, run the guard against a known-bad sample | Missing or set to `off` → CRITICAL: guard recorded but not enforcing; the pattern log claims protection that isn't there. `warn`/advisory without documented intent → WARNING |
| **Recurred despite guard** | Cluster has occurrences dated after `mechanized_guard.created` | WARNING: guard ineffective — blind spot, wrong scope, or suppressed; propose modify at triage |
| **Suppression growth** | Count in-code suppressions of the guard (e.g., disable comments naming the rule, skipped tests) and compare against the count noted at the last audit | WARNING when growing: the guard is being routed around, not obeyed |
| **Never fired** (best-effort) | For guards with observable history (CI logs, test runs): zero hits since creation | INFO: either the pattern is extinct (candidate for retirement) or the guard is miswired (verify against a known-bad sample) |

Findings route into the standard audit findings table; modify/retire decisions go through triage like any promotion decision. Retirement removes the `mechanized_guard` field and notes the retirement in the cluster's description — the occurrence history stays.

## Guard Modification Is In-Scope in Review Loops

When a review finding matches a cluster in `docs/reviews/recurring-patterns.yaml` that has (or plainly warrants) a mechanized guard, the fix is **two-part**: fix the instance, and update or create the guard so the next instance is caught mechanically. Fixing only the instance of a guarded pattern means the guard failed and is being left broken. This rule is consumed by `[sdlc-root]/process/review-fix-loop.md` Step C and `sdlc-review-code` Step 5a — guard edits (lint config, drift tests, CI wiring) are in-scope for fix dispatches without a separate approval cycle, subject to the same review loop as any other fix.

## Enforcement Floors

A guard does not need to be airtight to be worth having. A grep-based CI check is a legitimate floor when the full structural guard is expensive — e.g., failing CI on `KEEP IN SYNC` / `kept in sync manually` comments (see the Contract Safety Lens in `[sdlc-root]/process/review-lenses.md`: such a comment is itself a defect) enforces the single-source-of-truth rule even before a real drift test exists. Record floors with `type: ci-check` and note the limitation in `notes` so 6n doesn't mistake the floor for full coverage.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The pattern is documented in the knowledge store, we're covered" | Agents forget; machines don't. 3+ recurrences after knowledge promotion is the signal to mechanize. |
| "I'll add the guard but skip the yaml field" | An unrecorded guard is invisible to Dimension 6n — it will rot unwatched. The field IS the registration. |
| "The guard exists, so the pattern is handled" | 6n exists because guards go stale: rules get disabled, tests get skipped, patterns mutate past the regex. |
| "Fixing the lint config is out of scope for this review" | If the finding matches a guarded cluster, the guard update is part of the fix, not an extra. |
| "This pattern is judgment-heavy but I'll propose a lint rule anyway" | Name the machine-checkable signature or take the knowledge path. A noisy guard trains people to suppress guards. |
| "CD dismissed this candidate last cycle, but it's still at threshold — re-propose" | Dismissed ≠ excluded. If CD said "don't re-propose," record `mechanization_assessed: excluded` with the reason; if the fields are already set, skip it. Re-proposing an excluded cluster every cycle is the nag this field exists to end. |
| "The rule name is in the config — the guard is wired" | Presence ≠ enforcement. A rule at `off`/`warn`, a skipped test, a continue-on-error CI step, or a conditional registration that collapses at runtime all read as wired to a text grep. Parse the effective severity, or run the guard against a known-bad sample. |
