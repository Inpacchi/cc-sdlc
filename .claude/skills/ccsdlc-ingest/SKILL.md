# Framework Ingestion

Structured bulk import of external content into the cc-sdlc framework. The goal is to extract actionable insights from curated source material and route them to the correct framework artifact — not just knowledge stores, but skills, agent suggestions, playbooks, process docs, and templates too.

**This skill produces framework artifacts that ship to all child projects on migration. It does NOT produce specs, plans, or implementations.**

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (path to content directory or file list, plus optional target hint)

## When This Applies

Use this when you have a collection of curated external content to absorb into the framework. The hallmark is bulk external material that could improve how cc-sdlc serves child projects.

Signs this skill is appropriate:
- A directory of transcripts, articles, or documentation files
- "What can we adopt from these into our framework?"
- "Analyze these for patterns we should codify"
- Curated content from a known expert, conference, or authoritative source
- The content generalizes across projects (not specific to one codebase)
- Content about workflows, agent patterns, review processes, or development methodology

Signs this skill is NOT appropriate:
- Single file or single insight → add directly to the relevant artifact
- Project-specific patterns that wouldn't generalize → child project's local knowledge
- The user wants to explore an idea → `sdlc-idea`
- The user wants to enrich one specific agent → `enrich-agent`
- Competitive analysis → product research tools

## Artifact Routing Map

Ingested content can land in any of these framework artifacts:

| Artifact Type | Location | What Goes Here | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge rules** | `knowledge/<discipline>/*.yaml` | Testable, falsifiable rules with rationale | "All animations must use non-linear easing" |
| **Discipline parking lot** | `disciplines/<name>.md` | Promising insights needing validation | "[NEEDS VALIDATION] Consider spring physics for dismissal gestures" |
| **Agent suggestions** | `agents/AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md` | New agent role definitions or enrichments to existing ones | A new "devops-engineer" agent role with expertise description |
| **Skill candidates** | Noted in report (not auto-created) | Workflow patterns that could become reusable skills | A multi-step review process that could be a `/review-*` skill |
| **Playbook entries** | `playbooks/<name>.md` | Checklists for specific task types | New checklist items for security review playbook |
| **Process doc amendments** | `process/<name>.md` | Workflow or lifecycle improvements | Better handoff protocol between plan and execute phases |
| **Template improvements** | `templates/<name>.md` | Structural additions to document templates | New section in spec template for accessibility considerations |

## Core Principles

**Route to the right artifact.** The most important decision is where each insight lands. A workflow pattern is not a knowledge rule. An agent expertise description is not a playbook. Match the insight to the artifact type that makes it most actionable.

**Extract rules, not summaries.** For knowledge store entries, the output is testable, falsifiable rules with specific values — not prose summaries. "Use non-linear easing" is a summary. "All animations must use non-linear easing (ease-in-out or spring); linear easing is forbidden except for progress bars" is a rule.

**Think cross-project.** Everything entering the framework will be consumed by every child project. Filter for patterns that generalize. Project-specific tips belong in that project's local knowledge, not here.

**Respect existing conventions.** Each artifact type has established conventions. Read existing examples before writing new entries. Agent suggestions follow the format in `AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md`. Knowledge YAML follows the patterns in existing stores. Skills follow the structure in `skills/sdlc-create-skill/SKILL.md`.

**Source attribution is mandatory.** Every extracted insight must trace back to its source file.

**Filter aggressively.** Not everything in external content belongs in the framework. The test: would this make cc-sdlc measurably more useful to child projects?

**Deduplicate against existing artifacts.** Before creating new entries, read existing artifacts in the target area. If an insight already exists, skip it or merge source attribution.

## Workflow

```
SURVEY → SCOPE → EXTRACT → CLASSIFY → STRUCTURE → PLACE → REPORT → CHANGELOG → MANIFEST
```

The flow is sequential. Each step must complete before the next begins. The user confirms scope (step 2) before extraction begins.

## Steps

### 1. Survey the Content

Read the content source to understand what's there:

1. **Inventory** — list all files, formats, sizes. Count the total.
2. **Sample** — read 2-3 representative files to assess content quality and domain focus.
3. **Characterize** — describe the content in one sentence: who created it, what domain it covers, what type of knowledge it contains.

Present the survey to the user:

```
SURVEY
Files: [count] [format] files in [path]
Domain: [what the content covers]
Character: [principles / tutorials / case studies / reference / workflow docs / mixed]
Sample: [1-sentence summary of 2-3 sampled files]
Quality signal: [high — expert with rationale / medium — practical tips / low — opinions without backing]
```

### 2. Scope the Ingestion

Before extracting anything, align with the user on:

1. **Likely artifact targets** — based on the survey, which artifact types will likely receive content. A set of transcripts about testing methodology might target knowledge rules + playbook entries + possibly an agent suggestion. Workflow documentation might target process docs + skill candidates.

2. **Existing artifact audit** — read the current state of likely targets:
   - Knowledge stores (`knowledge/<discipline>/`) — existing YAML files and rule IDs
   - Discipline files (`disciplines/<name>.md`) — existing parking lot entries
   - Agent suggestions (`agents/AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md`) — existing agent roles
   - Playbooks (`playbooks/`) — existing playbooks and their checklists
   - Process docs (`process/`) — relevant existing process documentation
   - Skills (`skills/`) — existing skills that might overlap with extracted workflows
   - Templates (`templates/`) — existing template structures

3. **Extraction depth** — based on file count and user preference:
   - **Shallow** (>20 files): read all files but extract only high-confidence, broadly-applicable insights
   - **Deep** (<20 files): thorough extraction with nuance, including edge cases and conditional insights

4. **Cross-project generalizability** — assess whether the content is universal enough for the framework

Present the scope for confirmation:

```
SCOPE
Likely targets: [artifact types]
Existing state:
  Knowledge: [count] YAML files in [disciplines], [count] total rules
  Agent suggestions: [count] agent roles
  Playbooks: [count] playbooks
  Skills: [count] skills (potential overlap with: [list])
Extraction depth: shallow | deep
Generalizability: [universal / conditional — note limitations]
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

### 3. Extract

Read all source files and extract insights, casting a wide net across artifact types.

**For each source file, capture:**
- Actionable rules with specific, testable criteria → knowledge candidates
- Workflow patterns with repeatable steps → skill or process doc candidates
- Agent role descriptions or expertise areas → agent suggestion candidates
- Task-specific checklists → playbook candidates
- Anti-patterns with "why it's wrong" rationale → knowledge or playbook candidates
- Structural patterns for documents → template candidates
- Insights that need validation before codifying → parking lot candidates

**Filtering criteria — include if:**
- An agent acting on it would produce measurably better work across projects
- It generalizes beyond the specific example in the source
- It includes rationale (not just "do this" but "do this because...")
- It fills a gap in the current framework artifacts

**Filtering criteria — exclude if:**
- It's tool-specific workflow advice (IDE shortcuts, specific SaaS UI steps)
- It's an opinion without rationale or evidence
- It's obvious to any competent practitioner
- It duplicates an existing artifact
- It's too project-specific to generalize

**For large collections (shallow mode):** Process files in batches. After each batch, check for theme saturation.

### 4. Classify

Route each extracted insight to its target artifact type. This is the step that distinguishes this skill from the child-project version — here we're thinking about the full framework.

**Classification rules:**

| If the insight is... | Route to... |
|---|---|
| A testable rule with specific criteria and rationale | Knowledge YAML |
| A promising pattern that needs validation | Discipline parking lot |
| A description of a specialized agent role not in AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md | Agent suggestion |
| An enrichment to an existing agent's expertise description | Agent suggestion (merge) |
| A multi-step workflow that could be automated/guided | Skill candidate (noted in report) |
| A checklist for a specific task type | Playbook entry |
| A workflow or lifecycle improvement | Process doc amendment |
| A structural addition to document formats | Template improvement |
| Cross-discipline but useful | Adjacent artifact's parking lot |

**Do NOT auto-create skills.** Skill candidates are noted in the report with a proposed structure. The user decides whether to invoke `/sdlc-create-skill` for them. Skills are complex artifacts that need intentional design.

**Do NOT auto-create new agent files.** Agent suggestions go into `AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md`. Creating actual agent `.md` files requires `/sdlc-create-agent`.

### 5. Structure

Organize extracted insights into the format required by each target artifact.

**Knowledge rules** — follow existing YAML conventions in the target knowledge store:
- Group by theme/category into files
- Continue existing rule ID sequences
- Include: ID, name, rule statement, rationale, checklist item, source
- Set `spec_relevant: false` for new files (safe default)

**Agent suggestions** — follow the format in `AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md`:
- Role name as H3 heading
- "When to use" line
- Expertise description in code block
- Suggested tools list
- Place in the correct category section (Engineering, Quality, Architecture & Design, etc.)

**Playbook entries** — follow existing playbook format:
- Checklist items with clear pass/fail criteria
- Grouped by phase or category within the playbook

**Process doc amendments** — draft the specific text changes:
- Reference the exact section being amended
- Show before/after or new section content

**Template improvements** — draft the structural addition:
- Reference the exact template and section
- Show the new structure with placeholder guidance

**Parking lot entries** — standard format:
```
### [Category Name] ([date], source: [source description])

*Bulk import from [source characterization].*

- **[Insight title].** [NEEDS VALIDATION] [Description]. (Source: `[source-file-id]`)
```

**Skill candidates** — structured proposal (not implementation):
```
SKILL CANDIDATE: [name]
Trigger: [when a user would invoke this]
Steps: [high-level workflow]
Inputs: [what it needs]
Outputs: [what it produces]
Similar to: [existing skills it's related to]
Justification: [why this warrants a dedicated skill vs. ad-hoc work]
```

### 6. Place

Write each output to its correct destination:

| Output Type | Destination | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Knowledge rules | `knowledge/<discipline>/<file>.yaml` | Create or append |
| Parking lot entries | `disciplines/<name>.md` | Append to parking lot section |
| Agent suggestions | `agents/AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md` | Add new roles or merge into existing |
| Playbook entries | `playbooks/<name>.md` | Create or append checklist items |
| Process doc amendments | `process/<name>.md` | Edit existing docs |
| Template improvements | `templates/<name>.md` | Edit existing templates |
| Skill candidates | Report only | Do not write — present for user decision |

**Knowledge file placement:**
- Write new YAML files or append to existing ones
- Update the knowledge store's `README.md` to list new files
- If new files are created, add them to the README's structure listing

**Agent suggestion placement:**
- New roles: add under the appropriate category heading in `AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md`
- Enrichments: merge new expertise into existing role descriptions (don't duplicate)
- Add to the "Choosing Your Agent Team" table if the role serves a common project type

**Playbook placement:**
- If a related playbook exists, add checklist items
- If enough insights cluster around a new task type to warrant a new playbook, propose it for approval

### 7. Report

```

### 9. Manifest Sync

After writing artifacts:

1. Add any new files to `skeleton/manifest.json` in the appropriate section
2. If new knowledge files should be wired to agents, update `knowledge/agent-context-map.yaml`
3. Verify the manifest stays consistent — run the manifest completeness check from CLAUDE.md

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll summarize the content" | Extract actionable artifacts, not summaries. |
| "Everything in here is useful" | Filter aggressively. Most external content doesn't meet the bar. |
| "I'll auto-create a skill from this" | Note skill candidates in the report. Skills need intentional design via `/sdlc-create-skill`. |
| "I'll create a new agent .md file" | Agent suggestions go to `AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md`. Creating agent files requires `/sdlc-create-agent`. |
| "I'll skip reading existing artifacts" | Deduplication is mandatory. Don't create entries that already exist. |
| "I'll put everything in knowledge YAML" | Route to the right artifact type. A workflow isn't a rule. A checklist isn't a rule. |
| "This content spans 5 artifact types" | That's fine — classify and route each insight independently. |
| "I'll skip the manifest update" | New files must be added to `skeleton/manifest.json` and wired appropriately. |
| "I'll skip source attribution" | Every insight traces to a source. No exceptions. |

## Integration

- **Feeds into:** discipline parking lot triage, knowledge store maturation, playbook creation, agent suggestion adoption, skill creation, child project migrations
- **Uses:** file reading, existing framework artifacts (for deduplication and convention-matching)
- **Complements:** discipline capture protocol (organic, per-session in child projects) — this skill handles bulk external import into the framework
- **Does NOT replace:** organic discipline capture in child projects, or targeted enrichment of individual agents (use `enrich-agent` for that)
- **Downstream:** after ingestion, `/ccsdlc-audit` can assess freshness and coverage. Child projects receive new artifacts via `setup.sh` migration.
- **DRY notes:** This is the framework-level ingest skill (`.claude/skills/ccsdlc-ingest/`). The child-project version (`skills/sdlc-ingest/`) imports into `ops/sdlc/` paths only. The boundary: this version enriches the framework itself across all artifact types; the child version enriches a specific project's discipline/knowledge layer.
